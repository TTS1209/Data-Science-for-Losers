{"author":"esru","name":"t1_ctru1yz","comment":"I don't think those examples that you mention necessarily make them bad cops, which i know is an unpopular opinion to have, i think that just proves there human. Hear me out, these individuals are seen as morally corrupt for lying or not saying anything but in reality most people would not do much different. Humans tend to care more about relationships with people than about morals. We see this in peer pressure situations, and the example that if one had to choose between 3 family members to die or 10 strangers to die there is a more moral choice but its been proven that we are more likely to save our family members. Most officers who go undercover or just falt out report others see an **extreme** line crossed or someone new who has no emotional attachments to the others in the precinct. The radio and podcast by NPR called Planet Money talked about the morality of certain decisions in the episode on [Why People Do Bad Things](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/07/03/419543470/episode-363-why-people-do-bad-things) i genuinely hope you can listen to it before you respond. Lastly, i do agree that police officers should be reporting and keeping each other in check like in what happened in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KilJJGKORs) but the fact of the matter is that unfortunately that is an unrealistic standard because of how humans form relationships with others.","created":"1438738942","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"news","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/news/comments/3fqo01/c/ctru1yz"}

{"author":"wijwijwij","name":"t1_cuhjuci","comment":"You need to have a serious house meeting with all your roommates. You and the others on the lease have taken on all the risk, because your names are on the lease, and your credit will take a hit but the deadbeats won't. \n\nI won't ask how it's possible that you were short so often. Probably you had some kind of informal setup where each person sent money individually to landlord. So no one was keeping tabs on things. An unstructured setup is asking for trouble, especially if it is **8 people** sharing the space.\n\nDo what you can to find out who skipped rent when. This may even require people to show via their records (checks, bank statements) that they did pay. Landlord *might* be able to assist you with that by using their check-pictures or statements, and if you are serious about getting the right people identified, you might be able to urge your landlord to help you in this identification, as it is in their interest to get paid. But I wouldn't be too surprised if landlord said it's your problem to figure out.\n\nHonestly, I would say the LATE payers should be 100% responsible for the LATE fees. It's not fair all of you should split the cost of the irresponsibility or immaturity of the deadbeats.\n\nThen, set up a process going forward to gather payments (via check or inter-roommate transfers) and have one of you *who is on the lease* be responsible for getting this to landlord in time. I guess your current lease is ending, so this would be advice for future.\n\nLastly, in future, force all roommates to participate in signing a lease, so there is equal opportunity for everyone's credit to be dinged.\n\nThere is no excuse for roommates treating each other badly this way. It is essentially freeloading, with damage to your reputation to boot. If some of the deadbeats are already gone or won't pay, you will have to figure out an equitable way to settle this with landlord, then sue in small claims court the deadbeats for what they owe you. Else chalk it up to bad management of shared living situation and eat this cost as an expensive lesson in how sometimes people take advantage of others.","created":"1440690340","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"personalfinance","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ili69/c/cuhjuci"}

{"author":"Indarus1","name":"t1_ctq45wm","comment":"I agree with most people in this thread. If you allow for the monstrosity to move on your command without the hat, it'd be too little risk for a huge reward to get the monstrosity. The Altar of Storms (or whatever you call it) works for the monstrosity, so it'll basically be able to have 100% uptime unless the enemy intercepts it. \n\nThe point of the monstrosity is that if you want to keep it alive, you have to do it at the risk of there being a 1v1 or 4v5 somewhere on the map. If they buff Aba like this, it lowers the skill ceiling with the monstrosity and makes the lvl 20 talent, which is already useless, even more useless, since you don't need the monstrosity to quickly heal then quickly go back to lane. It'd need a huge buff, like having the lvl 20 talent increase the monstrosity's maximum stacks to like 50 or something, or allow the cooldown to start as soon as the monstrosity is summoned.

{"author":"nihilxnihilo","name":"t1_cumce7f","comment":"&gt; these are all reflections of the beginnings of a worldwide anti-capitalist movement.\n\nSorry but I think it's wishful thinking. Syriza and Podemas are protest movements against austerity and the EU. Sanders and Corbyn, if they were elected, might shift their countries towards a social democratic model slightly. None of them are proposing any real alternative to capitalism itself.\n\nThe main alternative during the 20th century was the Marxist-Leninist central planning model, and by any objective measure it was a complete failure. In the worst cases millions of people died. Yes there was imperialism and geopolitics from the West, but the communists did a pretty good job defeating themselves. \n\nWith Marxism-Leninism discredited, the problem today for the socialist left is that there is no viable idea to replace it. The best known \"radical left\" movement of recent times, Occupy Wall Street, were famously incapable of articulating what they wanted. You'll hear some vague talk about coops and worker ownership but no real plan on how bring this about. It's going to be hard to have an anti-capitalist movement, much less a revolution if no one has an idea to rally around.

{"author":"boythrowaway1337","name":"t1_cult2kl","comment":"I am male. \n\nI was in a similar situation as you (except as a male). I was largely bullied as a kid and I was/am a nerd. Even better - I started balding at 17 and have been somewhat self conscious of it (although not anymore). I had an alcoholic father that hit me as a child.\n\nI can't help you with the self-esteem or the need to work through the abuse. I just happened to be lucky and work through it on my own thanks to mindfulness meditation and just being self-observant. If the abuse troubles you, a therapist may be useful.\n\nI can help you with the logistics of getting a boyfriend.\n\n=====\n\nI was 26 with no experience with being in a relationship and I never even kissed or held hands with a girl. I did a couple of dates, but I always had trouble initiating.\n\nThen I met my current girlfriend (she was 31). And we went on a couple of dates. She was so confused as to why I didn't kiss her. Eventually, she initiated everything physically because she liked me so much - she kissed me, hugged me, and held my hand.\n\nA couple of dates later I explained that she was my first kiss. Her reaction was:\n\n\"OMG now everything makes sense!\"\n\nThe lack of kissing just made her confused - did I not like her?\n\nI just had a lot of nervousness and anxiety about it. It was something new and I didn't want to be \"bad\" at it.\n\nShe was SOOOO happy that she was my first kiss. It was a huge ego-boost and it made her feel like she was special to me.\n\nFast forward almost a year - and I can totally see us getting married!\n\nNow, your story may be different. Your first kiss may not be with the guy you marry - but as a guy I can tell you that most guys will be happy to be your first kiss and/or lover and/or boyfriend.\n\nJust find someone you like to date. Don't freak out about the physical stuff - it's like doing anything for the first time. You'll feel nervous and anxious about it. But after you've done it a few times that will go away.\n\nI'd go about it in the following way:\n\n- Find a guy you like to date. If a nice guy asks you out, say yes.\n- Go out on a few dates. Maybe try some LIGHT physical stuff, like hand holding.\n- Most guys initiate kissing - so you can likely wait for that.\n- If the guy doesn't kiss you, it likely means he's also nervous. If after 3 dates there has been no kisses, go ahead and tell them that you have never kissed a boy before.\n- Definitely let a guy know you are a virgin. This way they can guide you through the process and will have proper expectations. I suspect that most men will LOVE the fact that you are a 32 year old virgin and will think it's awesome! My only note here is to wait a few dates before mentioning it, but definitely bring it up before having sex (and hopefully before the heat of the moment if you can). This will help the guy plan :)\n\nHonestly, when I told the girlfriend I was a virgin, she was so happy. She was a fantastic guide and I didn't feel any pressure. Not to mention that it was a huge turn on for her.\n\nIn fact, sometimes during sexy times, she'll tell me stuff like:\n\n\"I love that I am the only woman you've been with\"\n\nI think thinking about it turns her on a bit.\n\nI told her she was my first kiss around date #6 (and a virgin too). We had a discussion and I told her I wasn't ready for sex. She said she respected that and would wait for me (as long as it was a reasonable wait). After a few make-out sessions, we would get so heated up that I would have to masturbate after she went home. At a certain point, I realized I didn't need to wait anymore, and I let her know I wanted her to be my first! She was so happy and flattered that I had chosen her!\n\nI think that guys will like it even more! Just be careful to communicate your desires:\n\n- Do you want something serious?\n- Do you want something fun but not too serious?\n\nIf a guy does not like the fact that you are a virgin, they're not worth your time anyway. It's a really good weeder. It will get rid of some of the bad guys out there.\n\nAnyway. If you have anymore questions let me know.

{"author":"Odd_Bodkin","name":"t1_ctz5np2","comment":"Not me but a new student assigned to the experiment in the lab. He came from *cough* CalTech. He was given the job of removing a few thousand cables from a patch panel, so that additional delay could be added (by adding a length of cable). This was so we could give the trigger processor (basically a fast computer) more time to think whether to store the data for that event or throw it away. Working down in the \"pit\" on a different project, I began to hear a suspicious noise. I walked around to where he was working, and he was busily snipping the cables one by one with a pair of wire cutters. Not even labeling the cables he had snipped. I said, \"Stop.\" He turned and looked at me. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. He explained the job he had been given. \n\nThe rest of his week was spent crawling around in cable trays, tracing cables by hand, and then reterminating snipped cables. And then he was shipped home.

{"author":"GeeJo","name":"t1_cu1dnae","comment":"**Question 1:** For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as \u201cbrutally honest and relentlessly fair.\u201d Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it.\n\nWhich film would you be most interested in seeing?","created":"1439453192","avg_score":"4.0","subr":"anime","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"4","url":"http://reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3gsdu6/c/cu1dnae"}

This results in English players not getting match time, as a result the price continuously goes up for **Quality** English players.\n\nPlus, there are few junior training clubs that focus on English talent, instead recruiting foreign players at a young age.\n\nI think Southampton is the only decent team with a decent training program.","created":"1439479087","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"soccer","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3gu7c8/c/cu1n6b8"}

{"author":"mew2king","name":"t1_cu94sy8","comment":"Honestly, Greg is one of the best and nicest people I've ever met. He's gave me free rent for the entire year (i lived with him for months), and greg paid the vast majority of the food for me/medz/axe, most of the days they came over, JUST TO BE NICE (separate from salary, literally just to help them out. As in good intentions). I know this because I was there, almost every day, as greg either 1) takes us all out for food or 2) buys or cooks healthy/organic food and shares it with us all.  It's convenient that every piece of good information is always left out all the time (because doing that every day for us all adds up). (By the way, the food he cooks/buys is always the most healthy/expensive version you can get, and he does this ALL THE TIME). What is believed to the masses and what is the real truth right now is not even close to the same honestly.  I know what is really going on and a lot of the people i met with \"good rep\" is not really good people and many of the people with \"bad public rep\" are actually great people. Greg is one of the people who are ACTUALLY really nice and trying to help people that deserve it and create a business with me. It's sad that when a situation is no longer good for someone they become one-sided on saying bad things and never mention any of the good. This has been happening a lot (both related and unrelated to mvg) in my life with a lot of different people and it's really stressing me out. If I truely thought anything about mvg was bad, i would have left and became just myself with one big sponsor (like cognitive which i already am part of). But I LIVE with this person and see him every other day all year on average, and it's one of the biggest ratios of \"good person at heart to unfairly bad rep\" that I have EVER seen in my LIFE. It's stressing us (me/gregg and much of the mvg team) out to the point that we can barely think straight anymore because of how frustrating it is. And this is the fucking truth. I would simply be doing my own thing if i did not think it was.","created":"1440043497","avg_score":"49.0","subr":"smashbros","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"49","url":"http://reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3ho7yk/c/cu94sy8"}

{"author":"coolcoconut123","name":"t1_cuizxlj","comment":"I know I'm late to this and maybe somebody can help in some of my insecurities. I know it only said one but fuck it. \n\nFirst of all my looks, I aren't or don't see myself as attractive as most people do. It doesn't help that I'm Asian in a white society and everything about me but my appearance suggests that km white inside (coconut). \n\nSecondly, weight, I can deal with this because it's a problem I can fix but I can't help but feel insecure about it because I'm overweight. I've recently gained some muscle and feel better. I can keep at it and I should be fine. \n\nI'm a lot hairier than my friends and other people, my chest and my back especially. I'm not fussed about my face because I can actually cover up my poor jawline with my facial hair. \n\nSweating. I sweat so much, maybe because of my anxiety and depression. I have a warm blood temperature and always sweat from my armpits, back, face and hands a lot. This sucks, I can't wear colourful clothes and I tend to wear jackets if I do wear colours. Recently it's been a lot of back and face sweat. Face sweat is probably the worse because I have to constantly discretely wipe my face and I have had to grow out a fringe over the last 4 years to cover forehead sweat. \n\nSexual anxiety. I used to have a gf and every time sex occurred I struggled to get hard or stay hard once I was. It makes approaching girls a little harder thinking I won't be able to get hard and if I do it doesn't last. Approaching girls is worse when I'm sweating all over and I don't know how to deal with it. It's embarrassing and significantly lowered my self esteem when it happened and since she's left I haven't really practiced in making sure I can pop a boner because the opportunity hasn't arrived and km scared if it does. If anybody can advise me on this problem it'd help a lot. This is my main problem I haven't a solution to. \n\nAnother is the size of my thighs and my ass. I know guys don't really need small thighs and ass but this prevents me from fitting into jeans. Waist wise I am okay but I'm restricted to large waist jeans because the jeans that are supposed to fit don't wrap around my thighs. Any tips in losing thigh fat? \n\nThanks in advance for your help ","created":"1440791701","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ipzhe/c/cuizxlj"}

{"author":"crappy_guitarist","name":"t1_cubrcsr","comment":"Hi and welcome!\n\nEgo twist is like buying a 1999 Lincoln towncar. It was a good product at the time, but has become obsolete, at this point. Have a look at the ego one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n\nThe [Ego One](http://www.joyetech.com/product/ego-one/): Comes in 1100mAh &amp; 2200mAh variants (this is the battery size). You also have smaller options ([Ego One Mini](http://www.joyetech.com/product/ego-one-mini/)), or bigger ones ([Ego One Mega](http://www.joyetech.com/product/ego-one-mega/)).\n\n\nThe Ego One is a stealthy flavor chaser. It comes preloaded with a 1\u03a9 (1 ohm) coil &amp; a 0.5\u03a9 (0.5 ohm) coil (in the box). \n\nAlso in the box, is a glass 510 drip tip (which is marketed toward the 0.5\u03a9 coil, in order not to be too hot for your lips) &amp; a 510 metal tip (i know its not stainless, because i shaved it down, to see whats inside).\n\nHere's a quick, broken down image of what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/2nkGIUi.png\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSize &amp; form factor: The Ego One is [105mm from top to bottom](http://i.imgur.com/NGPlInH.png), but, if you replace the drip tip with a smaller one, you can save 5mm. it has a 19mm diameter &amp; comes in Red, Light Blue, Black, White &amp; Silver. I owned the red one before getting the silver. i DO NOT recommend getting a colored one because the paint chips! The silver semi-matted finish, in my opinion, is beautiful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCharging: the Ego One comes with a stadard micro USB charger &amp; supports USB passthrough. This means that you can use it, while its plugged in (which is a big plus).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPros|Cons\n:--|:--\nReally small form factor, which easily fits in your pocket. |The light indicator is very faint. the reason for this is because it is behind the button &amp; is supposed to shine around it. It gets hard to see when youre outdoors [in the sun]\nSuperb flavor |The tank comes in 1.8ml. this is a very small tank, for some. I use the 1\u03a9 coil, so, in my opinion, its fine, because it uses a lot less juice than a 0.5\u03a9. However, i still carry around a small bottle of juice with me. \nTIt has a \"Mouth to Lung\" draw, which mimics an actual cigarette.|VERY IMPORTANT: The Ego One battery does NOT have a spring loaded pin. That means that if you screw on a different tank (or, if you screw on your Ego one tank too tightly), it may push the pin down. This will cause it to not fire. In order to fix this, you will need to \"jiggle\" the pin back up, using a small flathead screwdriver. To avoid this, do not overtighten your tank!\n--- |Some people have reported leaky tanks. I have had 2 myself &amp; i know of 2 others that own one &amp; i havent seen any leaky tanks. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote: You can also purchase (when youre ready) the [Ego One CLR head](http://www.joyetech.com/product/clr-head-rebuildable/). Simply put, you can build your own coils, based on your own preference. This will save you money (because you wont have to buy new coils) &amp; you can change the coil resistance to what you like (say, for example, the 1\u03a9 is too light, but the 0.5\u03a9 is too strong. You can easily build a 0.8\u03a9).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI hope this was helpful. :)","created":"1440249775","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"electronic_cigarette","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3hyrke/c/cubrcsr"}

{"author":"justkjfrost","name":"t1_cum2gvt","comment":"&gt; But whose society is it? \n\nEurope. Every country is interdependant on it's neighbors in the peninsula, whether we like it or not. On every level (cultural, economic, the one currency thing, population displacements, ...). Issues that affects one of us affects us all. So if one country collapses due to bad economics, it'll blew up in all our faces.\n\n&gt; Why not massive fiscal transfers to Africa and Asia from European coffers?\n\nFor the first one it's simple : What african economy ? :x We do transfer huge amounts of raw natural ressources tho.\n\nFor the second, they are currently investing huge amounts of money here too (especially China, Japan, a bit SK &amp; taiwan, singapore, ...).\n\n&gt; because you don't view them as perfectly deserving of it. \n\nIt's like taxes, we don't like paying those because we think other people don't deserve our money. However they are a system necessity. Without it, we don't have healthcare, infrastructure, power or water airports cops firemen etc etc. \n\nAt EU level it's similar, if for example spain really bankrupt, their agriculture could totally nosedive &amp; then you'd see tomato &amp; other vital prices litterally triple at the supermarket overnight, like if you were in russia right now. Or the prices of new construction because they are so invested in it. \n\nNot even counting the fact that a southern country collapse or paralized gov would mean another massive immigrant wave (locals AND foreigners that pass throught it) in the rest of Europe, that can't really handle it (current levels are already a prob, but imagine half of spain &amp; morocco on top of it, because there's nothing left for them in spain).","created":"1441044471","avg_score":"7.0","subr":"europe","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"7","url":"http://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j2e5l/c/cum2gvt"}

People act like racism isn't prevalent in society (when I say society I am referring to American society) but in all honesty it is. The fact of the matter is that the racism we are experiencing in the past few years is whenever it is convenient for the media to report on or whenever it is convenient for the government to pay special attention to. When an unarmed black teen is shot dead it makes national news but when it happens to a white teen no one blinks an eye. This is racism. This is wrong. Skin color shouldn't be taken into account unless the crime was specifically due to that persons motives being racist. What else is racist is that they refer to this as \"reverse racism\" when it is racism towards whites. That within itself is messed up. If a person is white and a victim of racism, that is racism.

{"author":"Dagan42","name":"t1_ctxqtzi","comment":"You are new, thus you are bad at the game.\n\nYou are new, thus you have beginner cards.\n\nThe problem is not really that you have few cards, but that you have a huge lack of experience. As a long time free2player, who only began spending money a while ago (When hearthstone became my favorite game) I often play at low ranks with the basic decks, or decks from only soulbound cards (the ones everyone has) just to see if I can win. I almost pull off a 50% winrate.\n\nI hate to see someone driven off by the competitive nature of the game, but it happens.\n\nIf I can help I'd suggest finding a cheep deck off of icy veins (not the best place to find the perfect deck, but a great place to start) and disenchanted every card you get until you have built that deck. For example, I can consistently take the [Cheep Pally Deck]( ttp://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/cheap-paladin-gvg-deck) to rank 15 to 10 in a season if I put my mind to it.\n\nThe truth is, the game looks a lot simpler than it is. You are not fighting nukes with potatos, despite what it might feel like (Unless you are running Wisp: Don't run Wisp). The truth is that your opponents are using the best cards they have, and they are playing them smart, while you are running the average cards you have, because you don't know which ones are best, and you are playing them poorly,  because you don't know better. \n\nI hope you stick with it: hearthstone can be loads of fun once you get into it. If you want to get in fast try to get as many rewards as possible. Do your daily quests, win a Tavern Brawl every week, and if you can, get 30 wins every day, it's worth it (you get 10 gold every three wins up to 100 gold per day).\n\nEdit: because I'm on mobile and my keyboard hates me.","created":"1439191649","avg_score":"0.0","subr":"hearthstone","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"0","url":"http://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3gf2cf/c/ctxqtzi"}

{"author":"modom12345","name":"t1_cu1vm0i","comment":"For your first suit, doing a fitting at a store might be preferable.  If you live near a location that has a store, I was extremely happy with Suitsupply.  Great fit, great people working there, great quality, great price (for what you get).  Their cheapest is $400, but it's well worth it for the quality and experience you'll get out of it. I receive compliments on the suit every time I wear it. Consider it an investment if you plan on wearing the suit several times a year or more.\n\nIf you'd prefer to stick with Combat Gent, I would definitely try the Slim fit first.  I purchased a suit from them earlier this year to be a \"workhorse\" suit and was very happy with how the Slim Fit fit.  I'm not skinny by any means but definitely not fat either. Their Slim Fit was similar to the Napoli fit from Suitsupply.\nWorst case -- it doesn't fit and you return it for either a different size or the Modern fit.  They have a good return policy; just make sure you email them about the refund if it doesn't show up on your card after you send it back (I gave it 5 days before emailing them -- saw the refund shortly after).\nOverall -- I was very happy with Combat Gent; it took a few orders to find my fit (taking advantage of their free shipping and returns) but now that I have, I'll be ordering more \"workhorse\" suits from them in the future.  It's hard to beat the quality for price that you get from them.","created":"1439491502","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"malefashionadvice","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/3gswf1/c/cu1vm0i"}

And they were both dictatorships (although at least the nazis started out as a democracy until they passed a bill that mader Herr Hitler the undisputable F\u00fchrer).\n\nThe nazis also tried to eradicate communists in Germany and repeatedly targeted socialists and social democracts (the latter of which Americans today refer to as \"socalists\" because the major US political parties are so anti-social everything else becomes \"socialist\" by distinction).\n\nIf you want to use the nazis as an example for socialist parties, you also have to use them as an example for nationalist parties -- and as both major parties in the US are nationalist (the Republicans more than the Democrats but all of US politics is extremely nationalist in the first place), that creates unintended connotations for them too.","created":"1440777066","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"interestingasfuck","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/3ip9j8/c/cuiq4mo"}

When I got there, she asked me all the normal questions: are you currently on bc? / oh, you're not? / what has your alternative been?  Well, our alternative was basically abstinence, because lots of stress and my paranoia over lack of pill doesn't exactly lend well to making time for intimacy.  I told the gyno that my fiance and I weren't having sex while I was off bc, and her response was \"Oh, good!\"  ...Oh, *good*?  OH, GOOD?!  Bitch, you should be *apologizing* that you refused an emergency extension.\n\nThe gyno's response made me absolutely *livid*, and it was just a couple months of Rx coverage.  I can only imagine how absolutely off-the-wall furious you must be that this asshole took a logical, carefully-made decision between you and your SO and decided to push his absolutely unwelcome and *uninformed* opinion on you.  \n\nSeriously, fuck that guy.

{"author":"ModestSimplicity","name":"t1_cu91rc2","comment":"**C9 vs mous BO1**\n\nThese are two teams who may have not been considered one of the *best* teams in the past but have certainly made a name for themselves these last few months. They are also two very similar teams. Each team relies heavily on their igl. Both also have great awpers, two of the best in the game. Then you have the star fraggers. I would call both of these teams high T2 and borderline T1, many would call C9 T1. This is a super important matchup, it's the first group game of Cologne. These teams share a group with VP and Immunity in group D, so winning this is so important as that one game buffer is ever important, and the difference between facing VP and Immunity is pretty large. The last time these teams played mouz looked pretty dominant, winning cache 16-5 and D2 16-12. This was at CEVO 7 LAN, and honestly while mouz was playing good I don't think C9 was in top form there, their play was sloppy. So far looking like this will shape up to be a good game.\n\n**Maps**\n\n\"fak\". Mouz should ban inferno, they always do and it's their poorest map, but maybe they've worked on it. C9 should ban mirage, they always do, but maybe they've worked on it. Here's where it gets tricky. Both teams can perform pretty well on the rest of the maps, and with what they've been working on we have no idea how this will go. I wouldn't favor either team here, and with both teams being good on most of the maps I think we should be seeing a close scoreline here. We'll probably see a map like cache or D2 where both teams are comfortable on it.\n\n**C9**\n\nWe haven't seen a ton from the Americans lately. In fact their last matches played were for the NA Qualifier where they didn't lose a map, which was expected. \n\n    The Players\n\nfREAK - Entry fragger, very selfless player. Great team guy.\n\nn0thing/shroud - strong fraggers, great aim, good team play.\n\nskadoodle - One of the best awpers currently\n\nsgares - igl, who the team revolves around. Great at his job. Usually bottom in terms of frags with fREAK.\n\nSo this team has a solid and strong setup. While they may rely heavily on sgares calling and ska's awp all of this team's players can step up anytime they need to. \n\nOne thing that I think will have a negative effect playing here is how heavily they rely on sgares calling. Mouz has without a doubt been working on new strats, something we saw when they played vs Kinguin recently. This is a big problem as it hinders one of C9's main strenghts. Also mouz's play style is good vs a team like C9 because they have very unpredictable play when it comes to things like positions and being aggressive. C9 has no doubt been studying the German's leading up to this, but how effective will it be when we could see completely new setups. Also, C9 previously struggled with mouz, but like I said I think they weren't playing great and on another day it would've been closer. \n\n**mouz**\n\nMouz is without a doubt the best German team right now and who many would consider the best T2 teams also. While at IEM they may have not performed great they didn't do that bad either. At past LANs, just like C9, we have seen this team play very well for themselves. They recently played Kinguin in a BO5 which they lost 3-0 which may seem unsettling but if you watched mouz obviously didn't want to reveal strats. Buying auto shottys, triple scouting, etc. Don't look into this match as a precursor to determine who has the advantage here. \n\n    The Players\n\ngob b - Great igl, helps hold the team together. Not the strongest fragger, but can hold his own.\n\nChrisJ - One of the best awpers in the game, star player of the team with nex.\n\nNex - Star fragger of the team, crazy aim and gamesense.\n\nSpiidi/denis - good support fraggers.\n\nOne place mouz is weaker is their fragging ability. They lie below in the support fraggers, shroud and n0thing are a step above Spiidi and denis here. But one place where mouz has advantage is strats. A large part of C9's play relies on sgares calling, mouz is a great team to counter this. They play very unexpectedly and have without a doubt been working on strats. \n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nWithout a doubt this will be a great game, and probably the best game tomorrow. Can the Americans continue the hype train and get the finals of their first real competitive major, or will they Germans and VP stop them in their tracks and give them a reality check? Honestly anything could happen, nobody knows for sure and both sides have strong points. The one reason I think mouz will win this (well, and because they're like the best team every, you know? \\*flair*) is how heavily C9 has relied on sgares so far. Hopefully mouz can pull out some new strats and surprise. Also note, odds are currently heavily skewed in C9's favor imo. 62-38 means really good odds for mouz if you believe it's a 50-50 like I do.\n\n**Risk:** High, about as high as it can get\n\n**My odds:** 50-50\n\n**My bet:** Odds are currently 62-38 for C9, this is great for a medium bet on mouz I think. I expect odds to get closer to 55-45 though. As long as they don't get closer than that then I'd put around 7-9% on mouz. \n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this analysis and can benefit from it.

Maybe he's really trying but doesn't really know what you want? \n\nOr he just wanted a quick morning bone and you confused the situation. \nEither way it sounds like your communication isn't great. Talk about trying new things before sexy time, maybe drop the subject in over dinner. Give each other feedback and encouragement and suggestions. Have a laugh about it, don't throw blame or accusations. \n\nIts too late now to tell him that you fake orgasms, thats a big truth that he might not recover from. But he can probably tell when you're not that into it, even if you think you're great. So maybe suggest that you've faked a few because you didn't know how to communicate your own desires/disappointments.\n\n If you break up, I recommend that in your next relationship, you start asking for what you like straight away and working together as a pair until you actually orgasm.

{"author":"myufabro","name":"t1_cudkeol","comment":"The cold bit into my skin like a hungry beast, never seizing, never withholding for a breath. It climbed onto me and pinned me down to the course wooden floor. Father stared at the fire place with his sullen bloodshot look, like a bitch being dragged from her pups. Harder and longer he stared at the empty metal frame as if the passion of his gaze could light it afire. As we shivered that night, the silence echoed through the hut of an apartment and shook us in constant intervals with jolts of awareness. But never mind the silence. Or the hunger. Or the illness or the destitution. We'd lived with those for our entire lives and never complained, or rather never had the right to complain to the millions around us suffering all the same. But the cold could've very well killed us, mummifying our forlorn corpses in an eternal state of pain. I could see this fear gnawing at father, eating away at his nerves more everyday. All winter he'd been degrading to this state but it made him more silent and stern. Now he twitched with anger at the cruel gods of Russian winters, and I knew he would not still until he had vengeance. I could see his quivering fingernail peel at the wooden boards as his shivers turn to shakes and his shakes turned to agitated movements. In a jagged motion he rose and drew closer the cold hole in the wall that by his expression, must have betrayed him. His stare never seized for a moment or a blink until in one swift movement he came down on her. He battered her with all the life he had left in him. Harder and crueler he smashed her while his bloodshot eyes turned into bursting red balls and pushed out as if they meant to join his arms in the attack. I'd never seen it in my own household, but somehow it didn't move me. The only difference it made was my stare and silence was directed at mother. Poor mother who directed her silence to the bloody wooden boards to which her life would be offered. But nevermind that. The cold was the only concept I could grasp, the only cruelty I could notice. I sat there in a silent vigil for the home we once had in the warmer days. All night I sat there never sleeping, never waking from my stare. We knew no cold for the rest of the winter but the cold empty place in me where mother had been.","created":"1440389241","avg_score":"6.0","subr":"WritingPrompts","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"6","url":"http://reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3i3y2o/c/cudkeol"}

If you walk into an investment bank and ask for the volatility of a security you're going to get the standard deviation.\n\nLet's think about it this way. Two stocks move very consistently, but in very different ways from each other. You wouldn't say they're volatile compared to each other. They're not. That makes no sense. They actually have very low volatility. What you are talking about is *covariance.* Trying to use the terms interchangeably will lead to confusion, which is why *nobody does it.*\n\nYes there are many ways to express many things, and arguing semantics is often pointless, unless there is a situation where semantic differences make somebody *objectively incorrect.*\n\nVolatility is not a comparative measure. Nor is it a comparative concept. Covariance is a comparative measure. Words have meaning. Just because you don't like or understand the meanings doesn't mean you get to change them.","created":"1438854480","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"technology","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3fv53e/c/ctteejf"}

It's easy to *say* \"I support women's rights\" or \"I support black equality\" or LGBTQ rights or whatever else.

{"author":"JacePriester","name":"t1_ctycr1c","comment":"Asus/BenQ over Acer. Asus, AOC, and BenQ all make high quality monitors. BenQ makes the best, but you are right to question whether the extra money is worth it. They throw on some extra features that may or may not be interesting to you (that's up to you). Between the Asus you listed and the BenQ you listed, both have the same contrast ratio (1000:1), refresh rate (144hz), delay (1ms), and brightness (350cd/m^2). Do you care about the added BenQ features? They aren't necessary. If not, go with the Asus.\n\nEDIT: I should add that one of the things that differentiates these monitors that you don't usually see is color accuracy. If you were using this monitor for graphic design work, photography, etc, you would certainly care about that. But then you'd probably have a high quality monitor built for that purpose, and not one that runs at 144hz built for gaming, unless you really needed to go dual-purpose. If you're interested in that, look up color accuracy tests for these monitors and compare. If not, don't worry about it, because all of them are beautiful if not technically color-accurate.","created":"1439238261","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"GlobalOffensive","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3gi5vt/c/ctycr1c"}

Try to find out what the bottom line of his fear is (does he think you'll become even more laid back and he'll eventually have to support you? Does he feel you've taken him for granted?)\n\n\nIt may be that you guys are uncompatible.

{"author":"MyMostGuardedSecret","name":"t1_cum1qfv","comment":"This is true for me of all parties. I don't like dancing. But when I'm at a party sitting by myself at a table because my friends all wanted to dance, people start coming up to me and asking why I'm not having a good time.\n\nThis always ends the same way. I first have to go into a long explanation about how I really am perfectly happy sitting here by myself and I won't feel better going out on the dance floor with you. They inevitably fight with me because \"oh you're just being shy\" or \"everyone loves dancing\" or \"don't worry no one is judging you,\" so ultimately I have to get aggressive because now that they've offered to dance with me and I've politely declined, they are basically trying to force themselves on my and I really don't appreciate it anymore. No matter how long I try to politely decline, they won't take no for an answer. So now I'm an asshole.\n\nI understand that \"normal people\" like to dance at parties and they don't understand that not everyone does. But its not your place to try to \"save me\" or to make sure I'm having fun. Just go out on the dancefloor and dance and ignore me and we'll both be as happy as we can be. \n\nGod I hate parties.","created":"1441043381","avg_score":"8.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"8","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3j3og9/c/cum1qfv"}

They are very close by the projections (ZiPS has them 0.2 apart by WAR, which is nothing). \n\nThe other Mets fan above was acting like it was ridiculous to say they were a bigger loss. Between the &lt;1 projected WAR gap and much greater value of Werth and Span in 2014, one could certainly make a reasonable argument that Werth and Span were bigger losses than Wright and d'Arnaud. That's all, and anyone that thinks one pair is obviously better or worse than the other is overreacting.

{"author":"lazyman12345","name":"t1_cu8b0qm","comment":"Man here, thought I'd give you a different perspective. Also, it's eerie how much I can relate to your husband - lots of facts are similar.\n\nI am a recently married lazy-ish kind of person. My wife nags me all the time to take the trash out, do the dishes, deposit my checks, and sometimes to brush my teeth when I'm too sleepy to do it at night. but I shower and always brush in the morning because that just FEELS good and clean. I have also called her a bitch on occasion but never because she nagged me about household chores.  I even became a teacher so I could have the financial means to marry her (i could not make myself propose to her without having a proper job). So suffice to say I can somewhat relate to the guy you are talking about.\n\nBut here's the thing - I suffer from depression and am getting medical help. In the worst days of my depression, I too have wished my wife would help me fill out applications. She never does though and I am secretly glad. I cry at times when I think about how burdensome I am on her. It's not fair to her... i cry because i'm unable to provide for her financially (I quit being a teacher to go to professional school. I've graduated but I'm still looking for a job, while working part time in a place infested with rats and fleas which my boss is too cheap to clean! Yep, this is after having a professional degree and now my in-laws and my own family and friends expect me to get a job that pays well beyond a teacher's salary...)\n\nBut you know what? our relationship is extremely strong - we cannot imagine a life without each other. Which kind of makes it worse because I sometimes wish she would leave me for her own sake (that's one of those \"worst depression\" days).\n\nI do feel like my wife mothers me at times and I tell her to back off because that is annoying as hell. It's also totally unfair to her. I do have a sense of what my responsibilities are and that just makes it horrible for me because i'm not living up to it. I smoke weed so I can become \"numb\" to my issues... it's just a stupid avoidance strategy...\n\nSo what do i have to say about your fiance's situation? I think he may need medical help too. He needs to see a shrink, if not for anything else but an evaluation for depression. Redditors here who recognize these symptoms aren't really medical doctors and even if they were, can't really make a medical diagnosis online on a forum! But a proper psychiatrist can. \n\nConvincing him to go see one may be like pulling teeth. I know it was very tough to convince me to go (because i felt life itself had no point anymore, let alone seeing a doctor!). But the way I was actually convinced was to notice that depression runs in my family. It's easier to see depression in others than in yourself, i think... but once i realized that people sharing my genes (family) were all depressed, it shocked me. i literally fell on my couch, stunned to realize that about myself. And so, i made the effort and got help.\n\nI refuse to believe your fiance' is just \"lazy scum\" or something like that. I refuse to believe that people like us can never change. We will probably never become high powered ceos of wall street companies or anything like that. But I think we can improve enough to manage a content life, if not a happy life. \n\nHas your fiance' always been like this throughout his life? if so, he is likely to STRUGGLE against these issues for the rest of his life. But that doesn't mean will succumb to these issues in the future either... but you should know that you will have to support his emotional issues for as long as you're together. (unless of course his depression is situational and not in his genes).\n\nI agree with some of the posts here - ask yourself if you're ready to prop him up for the long term. On his end, he DOES need to change at least a little bit (personal hygiene, for one thing!). If he has depression, see if it's genetic or temporary. And think hard about the emotional energy you will have to expend to be with this person for the rest of your life. If he supports you emotionally at least, then take that in to consideration as well. It may be worth spending your life with him if he helps you emotionally... that is of course, up to you to decide.\n\nAnd finally - you are not married yet. You do not have children with him yet. It may be super tough, but SERIOUSLY consider breaking the relationship because marriage is supposed to be a PERMANENT decision. And it's much more painful to break out of it later, especially if you end up having kids with him.\n\nSo in sum - he has to step up to show you the value in being with him... to the degree that he earns the benefit of doubt. Figure out what needs to happen to make that assessment (depression diagnosis, discuss his failings with him and see his response). Ask him if he loves you and whether he thinks the current relationship is fair to you. If he thinks it is not fair and breaks down emotionally... then maybe he wants to change but something is holding him back. If he doesn't see how this is a terribly unfair situation for you, then drop him IMMEDIATELY.\n\nSome men may be lazy but if their sense of justice is screwed up then they are incapable of changing. You deserve justice.\n\nPS: this is a throway account, but i'll be on it for the day to answer any questions or reply.","created":"1439996788","avg_score":"7.0","subr":"TwoXChromosomes","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"7","url":"http://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3hktk7/c/cu8b0qm"}

I unfortunately made a promise like that and so now I can't tell my friend about it (fortunately I've been telling her to break up with him for the longest time anyways). I could break my promise and tell her but that'd go against my principles (I always keep my word, no matter how shitty, unless it's to my parents because they can be hyper controlling :P). If he cheated on her again though I'd tell her about it.

A normal 29 year-old man should know that dating a 16 year old is not right. Without even having met the guy, I can tell you that something is off about him. How would you feel if you learned that one of your friends was engaging in a relationship with a 13 year old? I doubt you would think that was appropriate, and you'd probably think there was something wrong with that friend. That's how everyone in the age range of this man would see him if they knew. Ask him if he has told any of his friends about you and your age. A man who is proud of the girl he is seeing will have talked about her. Ask him very specifically - \"Did you tell them how old I am?\". He probably hasn't. I doubt I'm going to convince you not to go ahead with this, but I only ask that you very strongly consider what his motivation is for wanting to have sex with you, and what your motivation is to lose your virginity to a man almost twice your ago. Maybe talk to your friends and see how they feel about the situation.

Good news is, I don't even need a pay increase.

I'm salary and have streamlined my job processes so I can easily do the 40 hours worth of work in just a few hours a day. The people there are all really positive and it pays exceptionally well for an assistant job. \n\n&gt; I managed a company before that for similar pay. Sure, I was the boss, but I was always stressed and never really felt free even though I was in charge. \n\n&gt; Honestly it just takes patience to find a job like that. I sent out a bunch of funny, quirky resumes just to see if anyone would actually hire me just as I am... No mention of organization skills or punctuality. It did have the words \"Superstar Excel diva\" on there though. And what do you know? Actually started getting calls back from the Fortune 500 big boys. Apparently I stood out.

{"author":"090078601","name":"t1_ctu5bjl","comment":"After the Bad Blood video came out, there were loads of articles released where the writers believed that Bad Blood had a strong feminist message too. Empowered women in \"action roles\" where they aren't defined by their sexuality but by how badass they are. \n\nI'm not saying that **that** interpretation is correct either, and I really don't feel like I'm qualified to talk about what's 'more feminist' or 'less feminist,' but even if Nicki Minaj's video *was* shot as a feminist eff-you at the industry, it's not automatically clear when you watch the video. I know a lot of people that watched video, and very few of them came out thinking feminism had a part to play at all in Anaconda. Same with Bad Blood.\n\nWhich, again, I'm not saying makes your interpretation invalid, but my point remains, you can't arbitrarily decide that your interpretation for all these videos is the **only** legitimate interpretation. \n\nYou shut down the person who replied to you by calling Ed Sheeran \"bland\" the video stupid, and then throwing some hate for the Swift video too, but many people say the **exact same stuff** about Nicki Minaj and her work. And that's all I'm getting at. You can't just act like your opinion is valid and everyone else is wrong. It's incredibly hard to judge the story-telling ability of music videos because they tend to be so... non-linear, so it's immensely unfair for you to act like Anaconda's story-telling video is just objectively better than any of the ones nominated.

Sweden is anti-semetic, Obama is, he is practically a terrorist, Iran want's to destroy us, tyrkey hates us, the UN is a joke, Amnesty is a joke, in fact all NGO's a laughable\"\n\nAt some point when there is no one left but you with your opinion, you have to start looking inward \n\nEDIT: I have nothing... Nothing against Jews or Israelis. History made Israel behave like it does. But now it is time to wake up. It is not about you, no one really cares about you.

The weight loss alone is six to eight months at least.\n\n- You're going to have to have a conversation with her.  If you can at least start the conversation with all of her GOOD points, that's a huge help to things going better rather than worse.\n\n- The weight seems like a dealbreaker - if you can't be with her without weight loss, than you need to be upfront with that.  She can fix that but it's not overnight and she'll need a LOT of **positive reinforcement**.  Weight loss from negative complaining won't last and won't be fast. \n\n- Insecurity isn't going to get fixed overnight.  Sucks but true.  That's another one where the only way to work it is with patience and positive reinforcement.  Negative complaining will make it worse.  If you don't have the patience something to think about.\n\n- A dealbreaker for me is the suicide threat.  That's not acceptable behavior by her.

{"author":"dinladen","name":"t1_cu6v6al","comment":"I'm Australian (also a law student), and yeah this is the rationale behind a lot of the amendments to various states' criminal law. The eggshell skull rule is very well engrained; you take your victim as you find them. The typical application in Australia is the \"one punch\" law mentioned by someone else in this thread - the fact that your punch might not have caused death but for some unforeseen sensitivity (like how twins typically have thinner skulls) is no defence.\n\nThe key amendment was basically that prosecutors couldn't prove intent to kill in order to sustain a murder verdict, and they felt manslaughter shouldn't cover this situation. So in some states like my own they introduced the crime of \"Unlawful assault causing death\" which basically means that provided you assaulted someone and they die as a result, you're guilty of the crime and liable to 10 years imprisonment (typically manslaughter results in sentences under 10 years for cases of this nature).","created":"1439888625","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"TumblrInAction","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3ha8rp/c/cu6v6al"}

{"author":"heavymetaljew","name":"t1_cu9qlcx","comment":"&gt; I'm confident you did test yourself biologically and not just talked to a psychiatrist before considering yourself from the other gender and taking huge amounts of medication. \n\nAFAIK, no such medical test to look at a brain and prove a person is trans exists. There's quite a bit of variation, and doing something like that is likely going to be too expensive for most trans people that need to transition. It's also not needed for therapists or doctors and isn't used to approve trans people (personally, I think any trans person that wants to transition should be allowed to). I went through the standard path of treatment. I'd like a karyotype test at some point, but they aren't cheap, and what specific chromosomes I have really aren't all that important to me. As a person of science, I'm at that stage in my education/career where I don't make that much money, so there would have to be a lot of justification for me to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket over an intellectual curiosity.\n\n&gt; You wouldn't just take the word of a \"doctor\" whose only goal is to see you come back week after week.\n\nI only see my doctor for checkups, like most people.

The longer you wait the harder it is for him to snap out of this mode.\n\n2. You address the issue. Of course his feelings are going to hurt. That is a part of life - ups and downs. You tell him this and you don't sugar coat it. Hopefully, this smacks him in the face and he makes a proactive decision to change his lifestyle.\n\nBtw, sex is an important part of a relationship, especially in your 20's.

Another drop also came from the PRC banning of the soup at state banquets (ergo, wealthy, corrupted officials, not average \"culture\" or citizens). Many average Chinese citizens are also not aware that [ivory results in dead elephants](http://world.time.com/2013/11/01/the-ivory-trade-is-out-of-control-and-china-needs-to-do-more-to-stop-it/). Though, this may ultimately be irrelevant, since I doubt the average Chinese citizen buys or could easily afford such luxuries, so they're not really the problem in the first place.\n\nAs for the dog eating festival, that happens in one city, Yulin. Though, I'm not really sure why eating dogs is particularly barbaric or worse than any other meat. As for skinning them alive and stealing them, while I'm sure that happens, I think you may be hard pressed to prove it's a common method, rather than the most shocking that's most publicized. Dog farms exist and I'm sure you could find more information of Chinese people killing animals before butchering them than the converse.\n\nAnd while people may be \"angered\" to find out the truth about chickens, that has barely (if at all) affected the sales of poultry and beef. In fact, those who choose to free range or become vegan are often maligned in popular culture. So, that's some culture of caring.\n\nI'm not trying to say \"but America,\" or even trying to say the US cares less, but I feel you're making baseless assumptions based off of reading front page World News articles, rather than making a truly informed opinion.","created":"1439119438","avg_score":"10.0","subr":"worldnews","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"10","url":"http://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3g9gmu/c/ctwsa1v"}

{"author":"Sports-Nerd","name":"t1_cud763a","comment":"So the context of the quote is important. The \"constituted authority\" was referring to the ruling Brown vs. Board of Education (NOT THE POLICE), the Supreme Court case that de-segregated schools, as well as pro-civil rights legislation and court decisions. Southern Politicians at the time were being elected on pro-segregation platforms, and of course encouraged their supporters to protest or fight against it (as well as vice-versa). So no one, at least as far as major political figures, is really saying right now that you shouldn't listen to the police, some might be saying to protest them, but no one is saying that we should purposefully ignore a supreme court ruling, and are using hateful rhetoric to promote this point. I feel like a better comparison would be to imagine if the extremism of the anti-gay marriage crowd was doubled, and you had major politicians telling their audiences that gay people aren't people and other hateful rhetoric, and telling people they didn't need to listen to the supreme court ruling on gay marriage. Like I know some of this happened recently, but like imagine it being much, much worse.","created":"1440365528","avg_score":"0.0","subr":"news","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"0","url":"http://reddit.com/r/news/comments/3hylmc/c/cud763a"}

Now Cruz and Congress is now threatening to have ANOTHER sequestration just to shut down this bill by not passing a budget by the 1 October deadline. \n\nWhen it gets to the point that Republicans are willing to SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN, costing billions of taxpayer money, strongly decreasing morale for government workers, and ripples through the economy, just because they hate women, this article is  just nothing more than a Right Wing journalist trying to pick red herring arguments.

A popular theory surrounding that line, which is actually more rooted in William's own reasoning for starting the war, is that it's not King Philip II who's being sworn loyalty, but his father, Charles V. William had mad respect for Charles; not so much for Charles' boy. When the war started, William proclaimed that Philip wasn't a King at all, but a tyrant, unlike his dear old dad. So by swearing his allegiance to Charles V he's pretty much giving the finger to Philip.","created":"1440453195","avg_score":"9.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"9","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3i7wmg/c/cuedo2c"}

{"author":"Trollhoffer","name":"t1_culixbt","comment":"Right. One nearly inherent element of build systems is that saying \"yes\" to one thing means saying \"no\" to several other things. As a result, we're usually left with a character that's only exploiting a fraction of the game's mechanics rather than most of them. The first Witcher game played around this, as your skill upgrade resources were skill tier specific; at higher levels, you'd still be gaining \"low\" skill points, which means that you ultimately diversified as part of normal progression. That approach could stand to be improved, but I definitely like the direction of that moreso than Witcher 2/3's emphasis on narrow focus. \n\nDark Souls and its sibling games provide a good example of a build system that allows for versatility. What you can actually do (and how well you do it) will be summarised within your weapon moveset, movement rate and evasion effectiveness, spells, and your level of stamina. Different elements of this system aren't so much dependent on your stats, but scale with them. You can wield a claymore in one hand at 16 strength, but it benefits greatly from being used in two hands due to the way strength scaling works (your effective strength when two-handing would be 24 in this case, a +50% increase). The Souls games do have restrictions, but they're based less on can/can't and more on finding the build that works the best for what you specifically want. You can have a spellcasting build that also throws around extremely heavy sword blows, or even use a magical greatsword that has projectile properties. \n\nOr, we could say that the Witcher games are (mostly) built around \"hard\" limitations with their build systems, whereas the Souls games are based on \"soft\" limitations. The latter approach is a good compromise, in my opinion; it rewards players for making astute strategic observations and mastering the system, but doesn't lock them out of significant options if they err. Unless their build is completely off-the-rails inefficient, which is a risk given how opaque the system is without some early guidance, but that's more a matter of teaching a player one's game than its inherent system quality.

{"author":"Pensfan2987","name":"t1_cu5jym4","comment":"Well, this year could very well be the year. Datsyuk and Zetterberg are 37 and 34 now, while Kronwall is 34. These guys could just fall off a cliff (unlikely but there most likely will be some regression from these guys). Also, the goalie situation is a bit murky, Mrazek or Howard? Mrazek is a good up and comer, but IMO isn't a bonafide starter as of right now, and Howard has always been a mediocre goalie. If the young guys step up I could see you guys grabbing a wildcard spot, but theres a few teams that didn't make the playoffs last year that could also come up and take Detroit's spot (Florida, Columbus, perhaps Boston).","created":"1439784309","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"hockey","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/3h9a29/c/cu5jym4"}

I understand that it is difficult to use and to master, but with that comes the reward of by far the best maneuverability and evasiveness of the jumps (besides Titan skating, I guess, but nobody can do that well besides Gabe, so it's not a prevalent problem). I am absolutely fine with a blinker being able to evade an explosion by jumping far enough away from it in time; that's just rewarding good gameplay. The problem comes in when blinkers are rewarded by reacting too slowly (or getting caught off guard) with invincibility, even if it is brief and hard to achieve. No class should be able to be invulnerable from all AOE attacks with the right timing.  \n  \nI'll finish by saying that there are certainly other valid approaches to making blink more reasonable, this is just what I would do.

{"author":"Rain12913","name":"t1_cudly7d","comment":"I left this in reply to someone else, but I'll leave it here as well for visibility.\n\nThis is *very* common in college counseling centers.  Having worked as a psychologist at a rather small college (less than 500 students), it was rare for me to have a client who *didn't* know a few of my other clients.  Several of my clients were even quite close to one another.  Normally this would be something that would lead you to refuse a client or terminate therapy, but in a small college counseling center where clients typically don't have any other options for therapy, that often can't be done.\n\nNeedless to say, it was sometimes a rather difficult thing to manage.  Hearing one clients' perspective on a second client while also hearing the second client's own perspective was often very interesting, but it also made me feel quite anxious.  If Kristen told me that Jon frequently cheated on his girlfriend and was known as a drug abuser, but Jon had never brought either of those issues into therapy, I would constantly be vigilant about what sort of things I would bring into sessions with Jon (with the fear that I might mention something that he hadn't told me).  Sometimes I would catch myself attempting to shift the therapy in a certain direction based on third party knowledge I had gained about the client's life, and that sometimes felt unethical. I made mistakes a few times and said something that I may not have been told, but it was never an issue.","created":"1440392928","avg_score":"0.0","subr":"Showerthoughts","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"0","url":"http://reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3i3oyw/c/cudly7d"}

Meanwhile, motion blur is used much more sparingly, while texture resolution is noticeably lower in some cases.\n\n#\n\n\n&gt;**That said, the extra crispness and clarity available on the PC game due to higher-resolution assets and better filtering are a big draw for the platform** - those with top-spec dual GPU configurations can dial up the settings to the 'ultimate' preset and still enjoy extras such as SSAA (super-sampling anti-aliasing) for vastly superior image quality, or even ramp up the resolution to 4K - though beware TressFX bugs if you push resolution that high.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Running with the ultimate preset enabled and the original TressFX in action, it's clear that the Definitive Edition delivers an upgrade in select areas, **but fails to trump the PC game in all respects**.

Over the course of a week I gave 3 of them blowjobs and slept with 1 of them. (...Joseph later admitted to hooking up with an ex several times during our \"off time\"...)\n\nThe next week, Joe &amp; I went back to our normal PDA in the halls and in between classes that got us in trouble so often. Seeing the confused and hurt looks on these guys faces was wonderful. I never talked to any of them again.\n\nAnd Joseph, of course, beat up every one of them individually. Each were hurt twice as bad as the little native kids they hurt, and one of the kids got a rib broken.\n\nNo regrets.","created":"1438713333","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3fryz9/c/ctrdmpy"}

The episodes we watched a million times in the 90s became comfort food, building a sense of nostalgia that new episodes had no chance against.  \n  \nSo I just stopped comparing and the new episodes are fine. They're obviously not going to have the same impact after 26 years, and you can't make 500+ episodes without some bombs, but overall the show has been pretty consistent. It's the pop culture world that's changed more than the Simpsons. They started out as edgy, but once South Park and Family Guy were popular, the Simpsons seemed more like the Waltons in comparison (to steal a George Bush line.)","created":"1439784610","avg_score":"6.0","subr":"television","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"6","url":"http://reddit.com/r/television/comments/3h9ubr/c/cu5k3in"}

{"author":"Delta-9-","name":"t1_ctx1l8f","comment":"&gt;Are the irregularities simply anachronistic left overs from before grammar was solidified?\n\nFor English, at least, this is the case. Although, grammar never really \"solidifies\" in the great scheme of things. In 500 years an English speaking time traveler might be hard pressed to have a conversation in English with you or me. \n\nThe English copula (*to be*) comes to us with its odd forms from the verb conjugation paradigm of Anglo-Saxon (Old English). AS had two classes of verbs: strong verbs and weak verbs. Strong verbs tended to use *stem-changing* or even *suppletion* for conjugation. Weak verbs used a suffix instead. \n\nEx: \n\n* Strong verb *to help*: helpan (Infinitive) -&gt; helpe (1st present) -&gt; healp (1st past) -&gt; hulpe (past subjunctive)\n\n* Weak verb *to do*: fremman (Infinitive) -&gt; fremme (1st present) -&gt; fremede (1st past) -&gt; fremede (past subjunctive)\n\nAs you can probably guess, *to be* has been a \"strong\" verb for millennia. \n\nNot all languages show this irregularity on *to be*, however. Japanese, for instance, uses *desu* for its copular (to be) verb. As I understand it, this word is a contraction of an older form, *de arimasu* (still used in some literary contexts). The verb *arimasu* is actually still used and is a different kind of \"to be\" verb--rather than copular, it shows existence.\n\nEx: \n\n* COPULAR: American money is green. *Amerika no o-kane ha midori desu*\n\n* EXISTENCE: There is a phone.  *Denwa ga arimasu*\n\nThe conjugations through tense and politeness (yep, Japanese verbs change based on your relationship with your listener) for both verbs^1 are very regular. In fact, to my knowledge there are only two verbs in the whole Japanese language with serious irregularities^2, and those are for *to do* and *to come*. \n\n\nThe reason, I suspect, that *to come* and *to do* became irregular verbs is that they are both high-usage words--not just on their own, but also as modifiers to other verbs. Given their double-whamy in usage, those two words maintained their forms despite phonetic and grammatical changes to the language as a whole. \n\nThere is a tendency across languages for high-usage words to retain their forms over longer periods of time. *To be* is a high-usage word in (probably) every language that uses it, so its form would be more durable than that of words that aren't used very often. I expect Japanese will use *desu* for its copula for a very long time, and its conjugated forms may stay how they are today even if the conjugation paradigm for other 'regular' verbs changes at some point in the future. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nEdit: \n\n1: Discussed below, *desu* is not properly a verb. It is, afaik, a contraction of a verb phrase and its conjugation follows that of the original verb, *aru*.\n\n2: By \"serious irregularities\" I mean that the base form of the verb has almost nothing at all to do with most of the conjugated forms. There are several other verbs with small irregularities that crop up in one or two conjugations, but are mostly regular.

{"author":"martong93","name":"t1_ctx1ldr","comment":"I feel like I need to repeat this a million times before people finally get it, I AM NOT DEFENDING OR DIMINISHING ALL THE TRAGEDIES THAT OCCURRED IN THAT TIME PERIOD. What I'm trying to do is bring attention to history and historical complexity that many people are largely unaware of and that does not get received with as much relative attention as it deserves, it's fundamentally tied to the experience of the time and the people.\n\nIn the Eastern Bloc there really was no such thing as homelessness or unemployment from before the transition. Does this fact take away from all the other forms of suffering? No it of course does not. Does understanding the modern impacts of this take away from the lessons of those tragedies and the time? Not if you have any intellectual respect and appreciation for the study of history.\n\nMany Easterners didn't want the transition to happen the way it did. The neolibaralist fervor that was happening in the west under the likes of Thatcher, Reagan, and Kohl did not exist in the east, and most westerners mistakenly believe that the sudden wave of privatization and decrease in protectionism in the East that happened during the transition was part of the same economic-political experience that was ongoing in the west that they were experiencing.\n\nEast Germans by large wanted to liberalize politically and personal freedom wise, but most wanted that to be integrated into the existing economic framework. What happened instead was the existing economic foundations, which was not at all totally and utterly useless or broken, was completely replaced very suddenly and the reason for that was because it served private interests. This is a big reason why Eastern Europe is still behind, it's not to diminish the fact that forty years of mismanagement did occur, but to put all the blame of how Eastern Europe is the way it is today entirely on the communist period and not include the time period was the transition point to what it is today is entirely revisionist.\n\nMany perfect functioning government sectors were privatized, and that is something that brought a huge amount of suffering for Eastern Europeans. Was every government sector functioning totally well? No it wasn't. Does that mean that everything that did get privatized should have been privatized? No of course not either. It made a lot of people billionaires and filthy rich, but was worse of for national economic health and growth and the personal well-being of citizens. That's just something that in no way could be blamed on the previous communist management of these countries.\n\nSo to reiterate, there was some things that can be missed about the good ol' communist days, utilities were much less expensive, education was arguably better in many cases, and inequality was nowhere near what it was today (and not just because of the old tired trope of \"but everyone was poor\"). These are perfectly legitimate things that directly impact people's lives to feel strongly about. It's not from propaganda, but direct experience with a new type of suffering that honestly just did not exist in the old system. Does that mean there was less suffering in other ways? Sure, but does that mean that it justifies having to go through this new type of suffering, or that it was necessary? Not at all.\n\nHence why I like to point out that among the millions of people who lived in Eastern Europe, there are millions of different and personal ways to feel about what happened.\n\nYeah I know that people suffered greatly under communism. People also suffered in totally new ways they or their parents never suffered before directly because of the way the collapse of communism happened and the new system that took over. I'm not saying put them on a scale of suffering and make the heavier side the eviler one or the \"wrong\" one, what I'm saying is that you can acknowledge all suffering without making it about politics or ideology. If you do not want to accept that changing to western economic ideas didn't create suffering that is worth acknowledging, then I think you're not truly intellectually curious about history, but rather about ideology of some sorts.\n\nFor modern Eastern Europe, abandoning so much of what they had beforehand *was* a mistake. There's no need for false dichotomies of Communism versus the West here. Eastern Europe would have been better off with something in between. Saying that everything about communism was just objectively and wholly bad is utterly dismissive of the experiences of the millions of people who lived through it.\n\nJust to leave on another note. I am not defending all the bad things that happened as well because of communism, but I sure am also attacking all the bad things that happened not because of communism. My family was extremely active in fighting that system. Right now the fight that exists in Eastern Europe for a better society and better lives for people are much more so to be blamed on western economic ideas being used to further a corrupt system. Thirty years ago it was communist ideas being used to further a corrupt system. The ideas that westerners so embrace about why Eastern Europe is the way it is today are a huge part of allowing all this corruption to be validated. There are some ways that Eastern Europe is dysfunctional that it wasn't during communism. There's nothing wrong with wanting back functionality that at one time worked. You should ideally be able to pick and choose the best of any system. That's tragically not what happened.\n\nAs you said, ideology is a tool to help create more suffering. Well saying that Eastern Europe owes all it's problems to communism and that communism was nothing but evil is exactly the kind of prevailing ideological mistruths being used today to create more suffering.","created":"1439141983","avg_score":"6.0","subr":"europe","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"6","url":"http://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gc6wo/c/ctx1ldr"}

He is so fluid in supporting and harassing that i can cover the yolo plays.\n\n&gt;You would probably need hundreds of games to be sure that it is averaged out.\n\nThis is what i mean, stating that \"over the course of 20 games you should have fewer bad players on your team\" although may be technically correct if you dumb down the variables it doesnt really help anyone. I see the purpose in saying that the player in question is the constant but often the issue is matchmaking - although the solution may be learning to play with dumbasses haha.

I found the bit about the mirrors adding extra weight and 'anything that can fall is a hazard' bit to be fairly absurd as well. At low speeds (in-city) our echo location is pretty good actually. At highway speeds, the wind starts to interfere with our hearing, all the cars' tires around us make a ton of road noise, and if something is approaching much faster than you, it would be too far away to be really audible one moment, and then right next to you the next (as our stupid biker in the video demonstrated admirably). While riding, you can basically hear and echo-locate stuff accurately to a  distance of about 10-15 meters behind you. Any further back, and all the engine roars, exhaust noise, road noise, etc of a vehicle behind you is largely being directed to the back of that vehicle, and is almost inaudible to anyone in front.","created":"1439391879","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"gifs","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/3gkudb/c/cu0f7h7"}

{"author":"Atheia","name":"t1_cufjv68","comment":"You are just perpetuating the reddit hivemind. That all who create wealth are psychopathic monsters who deserve to die, or least would have no sympathy for them if they did simply because of their wealth. You perpetuate the \"us vs. them\" mentality that is exactly what we don't need. \n\nYou are another example of someone who makes stark and baseless overgeneralizations. Who are you to say how the rich view other people? You've never been in their shoes before. How could you possibly understand the contrast in the world, without experiencing it yourself? How naive of you to believe that no one would have any feelings towards someone else simply because of their wealth. Do you know why it is such a cultural taboo to ask someone what their salary is? Because they don't want anyone to think less of them, and they are talking about people like you.\n\nPerhaps you believe that people should be erased from history - to be \"unpersons,\" for various reasons. At least, that's what your comment history implies. Do you know who else thought the exact same as you? You know how lucky we are that people like you are no longer in power and are simply reduced to the status of keyboard warrior slacktivist, viewed by the outside world as a vocal minority not to be taken seriously? \n\nThere are many shades of the world, many angles at which it can be looked at, and your worldview is indeed a distorted angle colored with the muddiest shade of gray.

{"author":"NotaFrenchMaid","name":"t1_cu86b5q","comment":"I was a hotel housekeeper. We had a young couple (maybe early 20s) check in. They stayed a week or so. They kept their Do Not Disturb sign on the whole time, meaning I couldn't go in even if they were out\u2014 they just collected towels and TP from me if they needed it. I was starting to dread their room because typically, people aren't very clean when they're in hotel rooms, so if housekeeping isn't allowed in, it's a mess. \n\nSo check-out day comes and they extend their stay, BUT they went out and put the sign up for me to go in. I walk in.... And the toilet literally contains a mountain of used TP. It was piled so high it was at the seat. Basically, they'd been using the toilet for a week without flushing, I guess it had gotten clogged and instead of plunging it or calling me to, they just kept using it. I don't even want to imagine what it looked like under the toilet paper. \n\nI called my boss up to the room and showed her. She said we'd have to put some gloves on and dig the TP out by hand. I refused because you do not pay me enough to dig someone's waste out with mg hands. So I held the garbage bag while she did ;) then ran to stick my head out the open window because I was about to be sick. Oh, and she told them when they returned that they were checking out today and could find somewhere else to go. They were pissed. They also insisted the toilet was clogged when they arrived and it wasn't their doing. Which is absolutely bull, because when anyone arrives and finds something off, they complain to try and get a discount.\n\nTL;DR hotel guests used toilet for a week without flushing. Refused, let boss clean it. We kicked them out.

{"author":"decemberwolf","name":"t1_ctu52a3","comment":"&gt; This is a ridiculous argument, seriously what are you using to back this up?\n\nWell, the entire point of unions is to provide collective bargaining power for the working person. I'm not going to argue as to whether unions are performing their role correctly at the moment, but I was referencing the theory.\n\n&gt; We should fund them with tax payer money because some people think they work for the good of taxpayer?\n\nthat's a straw man. Nobody is suggesting we fund unions from taxes. This is a very small amount of money which provides not only an easy way to pay union dues, but also makes it much easier for everyone in unions to have their dues deducted from their income tax. Even if only half the people in unions claimed their tax returns back, I expect it would cost at least 6million in man hours from HMRC to process all the additional return forms. Factor in as well the cost of the MPs actually wasting their time with this and it isn't saving any money really at all.\n\n&gt; Whatever your political beliefs surely you can see that it is fair TU pay the bill for collecting their subs?\n\ncontext is everything. We sub a lot more for a lot less all the time and the government does nothing. Regardless of your stance on whether this is a good idea, do you agree or disagree that the cost saving is not the true motivation of the government here.","created":"1438900399","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"unitedkingdom","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3fz79n/c/ctu52a3"}

{"author":"Seems-Reasonable","name":"t1_cujxek2","comment":"I totally understand what you're saying. I agree to a degree, as well. But the issue is that we end up with an arts experience that culminates at the top. So only the rich are able to produce art, with the exception of the extremely talented, which is more or less what we saw in the pre-modern world. Most people would agree we have progressed as a culture, to expand and appreciate these things. I'm not saying that every kid should be an artist, but I certainly think everyone should have access to it. A well rounded education breeds more intelligent people, and a free education that is still competitive would breed far more soul-searching styles of learning, branching out and a more general-learning experience. I think those are important things we need as a society. And as far as competition is concerned, when anyone can afford college, it will make placement that much harder. Maybe we disagree on implementation, but it seems like we both have a pretty clear understanding of the *purpose* of colleges. I look at Germany's system and I see a functional system that produces some of the best engineers, bankers, doctors and business owners in the world, and yet is still free. Their system also provides education for those that don't make it to university, with trade and vocational schools, which I believe are equally important. So, raise my taxes and put kids in schools where they can learn *and* find a place in the world after learning.

Yes it's wrong their habitat is getting destroyed but bamboo is useful as fuck and we are growing more to try and compensate. Furthermore this wouldn't be a huge issue if pandas themselves hadn't swapped to sustaining themselves on bamboo because they're lazy as fuck. You think nature designed a herbivore that big? Show me another vegetarian bear....\n\nThey swapped to bamboo and that's why they're so listless and lazy and useless as fuck, they sleep all the time and got no libido because of it.

For fuck sakes, some lazy greedy bear gets to get pampered and watch porn all day (they have DVDs made for them) while I have to get up and work? Lazy, lazy, lazy fucking shits I really hate how much money is spent on them to. Although given the fact that China has not one animal right law I think it's pretty likely if people thought they were magic or some shit they'd be hunted to extinction by now. But no, is it because of their colour scheme? Do people actually find them cute? It's just a bear with shit camouflage, for fucks sake why don't you go admire a lemur instead? They're cute as fuck and acrobatic and shit and actually know how to fuck each other. Wasting money on giving pandas sex lessons? Even snails know how to fuck. \n\nJesus Christ I hate pandas ok, why'd you even bring them up? By the way if you make this speech in public people get really pissy with you.

Don't let him tell you it's anything to do with you.\n\nSecondly, please try and think your next steps through. My personal experience: I was with someone for three years and he started soliciting sex and posting craigslist ads looking for hookups midway through our relationship. The first time I found out, I let it slide. In retrospect, I should not have done that. It continued (stealthily) through the remainder of our relationship. I'm glad I didn't catch anything, come to think of it...while our relationship had many other problems, I think this was one of the worst ones. Cheating (a violation of your trust, as someone has mentioned below!!!) is something that I cannot forgive and could not let go. You deserve someone better!!\n\nWhatever you decide, please don't stay with him because you are comfortable.

You don't lock on and it doesnt really matter which direction the swing comes from, as long as the blocker is looking at the weapon, it will block.\n\nThis game uses a tri-directional blocking / swinging system. You can do a heavy or light swing from the left, right, or overhead, and the blocker must predict or react in time with the respective directional block to counter your attack.

{"author":"InHonorofMyInbox","name":"t1_cuj3ozt","comment":"Texan here! I literally went from not knowing how to use a gun to having passed the CHL written/shooting requirements in 8 hours. The background check didn't take long, and I literally had my license in my hand maybe a month after learning how to shoot. \n\n**THIS IS A PROBLEM!**\n\n**Background:** my dad was a gun smith, and I literally grew up around guns (like most Texans). I was never particularly interested in guns, and my father never forced me to shoot one; he did require that I learn that guns need to be respected, and I should never touch one without proper training from him or someone else. I had no interest; so, I never touched a gun. When he died unexpectedly I felt incredibly guilty because teaching his darling girls to shoot was something he always wanted to do. I miss him everyday and getting a CHL was something I wanted to do to honor him. The instructor held two classes one after the other: a beginning class (people who have never touched a gun before) and a CHL certification class. I felt good after taking the class and meeting the requirements but didn't touch another gun for months. My birthday came around, and my mother wanted to buy me a gun for protection. I had a CHL; so I thought it was a good idea. I had a freaking break down in the store when I couldn't pull the gun open (I knew the terminology when I took the test, but that was a while ago) to check the chamber/load it. I still do not own a gun and will not until I get more training. The moral of this story is not what a stupid girl I am. It is that no one SHOULD be able to own a gun without proper training. Not just 8 hours. I mean a lot of training. Guns are a way of life in Texas, and I acknowledge that many people grow up with proper training. Maybe we should blame the guy who certified me because I clearly was not ready - well I did score the highest in the class at the shooting range...but still. I do not feel good about how easy it was for me (or how easy it will be for other unqualified citizens) to get a CHL.","created":"1440797603","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"bestof","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3iqdyp/c/cuj3ozt"}

{"author":"Arianity","name":"t1_cuei466","comment":"&gt;You could actually argue that social security has completely failed.  There is not one responsible financial planner who will tell you to rely on social security for your retirement.  In fact, the more realistic view is that you plan for your own retirement and use social security money as a little extra.\n\n&gt;When it was initially instituted, it was going to be retirement income for all!  Now, if you hear about someone who \"has to live off social security\" then you pity them and know that they are having a hard life.\n\nI could be wrong,but I've never heard of it being retirement income for all.it was always supposed to be a supplement \n\n&gt;I'm not opposed to it, but something has to be done.  Let's say you make $75,000 for 40 years (simplified for math's sake).  At 6% that means you put $180,000 over those 40 years.  If you had invested that amount and got a terrible return (4%) you would have $428,000.  At a decent return (8%) you get $1.16 million.  Split the difference, you have $794,000 - enough to provide about $65,000 per year in income without ever touching your principal.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, social security kicks in (with insane rules about who can use it, when you can access it, all that crap) and you get MAYBE $2,000 per month.  Even the crappy return gives you about $2800.\n\n\n&gt;That's why people want to privatize social security.  Because the government is forcing me to pay into a retirement account that has worse returns than even the worst investments I could make out in the market.\n\nOn the other hand,you can worry less about people getting boned by the market or being too stupid to save for the future.to me,that's always been the real benefit-as much as we like to pretend,the vast majority of people suck at saving money.just look at how under funded most people's personal retirement accounts are. If I recall,they're short something like 40% of costs on average.\n\nThat's always been the real benefit,to me-it forces people to save","created":"1440460894","avg_score":"10.0","subr":"politics","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"10","url":"http://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3i8ve0/c/cuei466"}

{"author":"Good_Dave","name":"t1_ctvqafw","comment":"It's quite easy to get pulled underneath a moving vehicle, so the officer would hardly have been out of danger.\n\n\nTo understand why the officer is justified in his decision to use deadly force one must look at the situation from their perspective and must understand that the officers decision must be judged according to with objective reasonableness at the moment the decision was made, not with 20/20 hindsight.\n\n\nThe subject demonstrated the ability/capability, intent, and opportunity to harm the officer by driving his vehicle at/toward him. Attempting to hit someone or push someone with a vehicle is assault with a deadly weapon. At this point, the officer's life _is_ potentially in danger, and use of deadly force _is_ justified.\n\n\nNow, if new facts come out that prove the officer was not in danger from the subjects attempt to hit them with the vehicle, that _might_ make the officers use of deadly force unjustified. However, there is more than just the officer's life/health/danger to consider.\n\n\nThe officer had an objective in the moment he decided to use deadly force. The objective was to stop the subject from continuing their course of action. The course of action was attempting to use deadly force against another person.  Neither a taser nor pepper spray nor a baton would stop a moving vehicle. A lesser level of force would not have accomplished the objective. Simply allowing the driver to leave could be a very bad decision since the individual, when they had the opportunity to do so, demonstrated the ability/capability and intent to use deadly force (the vehicle). Since a person who demonstrates the willingness to use deadly force against one person (the officer) they might very well use it against another person.That means that the subject poses a potential deadly threat to others nearby. That is a second criteria by which the use of deadly force is justified.\n\n\nThat's just two ways in which the officers actions were justified according to the facts that have been presented in reports so far. If there may be additional facts are presented that call the justification of the officer's use of deadly force into question; but so far, none have been presented.

{"author":"cdanzig","name":"t1_ctqqmvf","comment":"It's tough to complain that the East Hampton Cops are out enforcing parking laws (that's pretty much their job). You don't seem to express that the parking is mislabeled or poorly labeled. Just that the police shouldn't be quite so diligent in enforcing the posted restrictions. If you parked longer than 2 hours in a 2 hour parking spot- you deserve a ticket. Am I wrong? The \"don't they have something better to do\" argument also falls somewhat flat in a town where there's precious little crime (of any type). The traffic enforcement team is primarily (as you noted) comprised of high school and college aged kids that I am sure more than pay for themselves- leaving actual cops free to take on drunk bros on the beach and petty theft. In my opinion this is one of the best ways they can serve the public: keeping the streets and parking lots moving for a population that grows by an order of magnitude in the summer months","created":"1438660530","avg_score":"13.0","subr":"videos","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"13","url":"http://reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3fp6bc/c/ctqqmvf"}

{"author":"bravo009","name":"t1_cu3ydv6","comment":"Ok, so I took out my copy of \"Scott Mueller's Upgrading and Repairing PC's\" and went to the Troubleshooting section and found the following.\n\n**Troubleshooting by the Bootstrap Approach**\n\nAnother variation on this theme is the \"bootstrap approach\", which is especially good for what seems to to be a dead system. In this approach, you take the system apart to strip it down to the bare-minimum necessary, functional components and then test it to see whether it works. For example, you might strip down a system to the chassis/power supply, bare motherboard, CPU (with heatsink), one bank of RAM, and a video card with display and then power it up to see whether it works. In that stripped configuration, you should see the POST or splash (logo) screen on the display, verifying that the , CPU, RAM, video card, and display are functional. If a keyboard is connected, you should see the three LEDs (capslock, scrlock, and numlock) flash within a few seconds after powering on. This indicates that the CPU and motherboard are functioning because the POST routines are testing the keyboard. After you get the system to a minimum of components that are functional, you should reinstall or add one part at a time, testing the system each time you make a change to verify it still works and that the part you added or changed is not the cause of the problem. Essentially, you are rebuilding the system from scratch using the existing parts, but doing it one step at a time.\n\nMany times, problems are caused by corrosion on contacts or connectors, so the mere act of disassembling and reassembling a PC will \"magically\" repair it. \n\n**Tips**\n\n\n* Eliminate unnecessary variables or components that are not pertinent to the problem.\n\n* Reinstall, reconfigure, or replace only one component at a time.\n\n* Test after each change you make.\n\n* Keep a detailed record (write it down) of each step you take.\n\n*If you hit a roadblock, take a break or work on another problem. A fresh approach the next day often reveals things you overlooked.\n\n*Don't overlook the simple or obvious. Double-and triple-check the installation and configuration of each component.\n\n*Cables and connections are also a major cause of problems, so keep replacements of all types on hand.\n\n\nBefore starting any system troubleshooting, you should perform a few basic steps to ensure a consistent starting point and to enable isolating the failed component:\n\n\n1. Turn off the system and any peripheral devices. Disconnect all external peripherals from the system, except for the keyboard and video display.\n\n2. Make sure the system is plugged into a properly grounded power outlet\n\n3. Make sure that a keyboard and video display are connected to the system. Turn on the video display, and turn up the brightness and contrast controls to at least two-thirds of the maximum.\n\n\nOk... This is all that I read from the book. I am crossing all my fingers that you will read something here, go \"AHA\", and then make your system work. I really really do\n\n\nTL;DR: Plug a keyboard and turn on the power. If the keyboard does not power on, that might indicate a bad CPU.

{"author":"nssmuckers","name":"t1_cud6y40","comment":"You've linked a video that contains a bunch of combination play in various areas of the pitch. Many of the attacks are even counters when Arsenal actually have a numbers advantage. If you want to argue about which club plays the cutest football, feel free to make the thread. I'm talking about which team in the Premier League is best at systematically scoring goals against a low block, and your video isn't exactly a documentation of Arsenal's prowess in that area. Believe it or not, finishing is also a big factor in breaking teams down, so arguing that your team sucks at finishing doesn't really do a lot for me. \n\nI also don't think chance creation statistics are pertinent here because they don't account for the systematic way that City create better opportunities than their competition against a packed box. It's something that should be obvious to anyone who watches the Premier League with regularity. City are masters of cutting the ball back and creating clear chances around the penalty spot. They create scenarios where players don't even have to apply the perfect finish. If you have a metric for number of chances put on a platter for someone around the penalty spot, I'll be interested. \n\nYou want to talk about last season it seems, but let's go back to the season where Wilshere scored the goal you linked. City scored 34 more goals than Arsenal in 13/14. I don't think it's really even debatable: City have generally been a far more effective attacking side than Arsenal over the last 4-5 years. And a big part of that is their vastly superior consistency and precision when breaking down teams that defend deep. \n\n","created":"1440365127","avg_score":"13.0","subr":"soccer","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"13","url":"http://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3i3ffz/c/cud6y40"}

{"author":"_From_The_Internet_","name":"t1_cuenvls","comment":"This was before 9/11.\n\n\nI (white Cuban-American) was taking a Muslim girl to her prom. We kinda grew up together hating our own parents for their stupidity. We learned a lot about sex from each other and she was just one of the few well-trusted friends I have had. The bad part, ironically, was that my pseudo-Christian parents didn't want us to be friends. She showed up at my house. Unfortunately, the strongest bigots, my uncle and step-grandfather were there too. \n\nBack story: these guys had been getting physically abusive with me for other domestic shit. \n\nSo, she's there in her very beautiful dress and make up looking absolutely gorgeous...I mean. BEAUTIFUL. When I start heading out, the bigots rush and prevent me. They yell at her to leave because I'm not going anywhere tonight. She started crying and begging and asking \"Why?!!!!\"  Looks at me and calls out my name and I tell her that I'm so sorry. You could feel her heart ~~c~~shatter. It's what we've been dreaming of doing for so long. Two social outcasts that felt great together for years. I seriously see the event as torture. I went into my room, cried into my pillow, and vowed that will never happen to us again. \n\nFrom then on, I cut my family off as much as I could. I would be gone as much as possible and didn't speak to them unless had to. The girl and I kept loose contact, but she was very guarded with me and the relationship just went away. I joined the Marine Corps shortly after and never saw her again.\n\nI hadn't really thought about that for a long long time and writing reminded me of the great times we had discovering adulthood together because our parents weren't accepting. It was definitely a beautiful part of my life.

{"author":"novanleon","name":"t1_cu1mzov","comment":"I'm pro-life. This is what I don't understand about people who are pro-choice, and I've never received a rational response.\n\nPregnancies don't \"just happen\". Except in cases of rape, a clear choice is made to have sex. Pro-choice people just believe you should be able to have sex as frequently as you want with no consequences. They act as if pregnancy is forced on them when it's really just the natural result of having sex (duh!?). They see abortion as just another form of birth control that allows them to continue living a consequence-free lifestyle. If you're not ready to accept the risk, just don't have sex. The *choice* is simple. The term \"pro-choice\" itself is a misrepresentation of the \"pro-abortion\" position.\n\nPeople use many justifications for being pro-abortion. Many view an unborn baby/fetus/zygote/whatever as a \"parasite\" that the woman is \"infected\" with (false equivalence). Many use poverty and over-population as excuses (appeal to consequences, slippery slope). Many concede that abortions are terrible things but that women should still have the \"choice\" to abort, as if it's a fundamental human right (verifiably false). Many view pregnancy as tantamount to enslavement and view abortion as \"liberating\" to women (false equivalence). Most, if not all, rely on a vague interpretation of \"life\" and debate about when \"life\" actually starts. The pro-abortion position is convoluted and introduces all sorts of vaguely defined variables to justify the unrestrained pursuit of recreational sex. Meanwhile the pro-life position is so simple, it borders on being obvious. As petty as it sounds, people just don't like it because it requires sacrifice and personal responsibility.\n\nEDIT: Rephrased to sound less confrontational.","created":"1439478786","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"funny","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3gtqnj/c/cu1mzov"}

{"author":"ReactineReaction","name":"t1_cu4shhh","comment":"Really personal preference, but the sound is different. Enough where you could tell from a blind sound test. The old-timey sound is definitely real, as the graininess of the record can be heard. For instance, the physical activity of a disc spinning can cause the music to warble and resonate more strongly than a CD, and I personally find the sound to be a bit more plump, richer, and warmer. At the same time, the overall sounds is a bit more crunchy, but the lows and mids of the music seem to be more pronounced on the records.\n\nWhat I mean by crunchy can best be explained by listening to Headlines by Drake. An extremely popular artist, but given the context a bit of an odd reference. Anyways, just focus on the sound of the hi-hats. (You can hear the crunch even in the horns though)  This is a very similar sound / ambience that records seem to add to your normal CD listening experience.","created":"1439729230","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3h6pmk/c/cu4shhh"}

Every other NA team will get crushed in lane swaps, will get crushed in TP plays mid game, and will lose in lane. C9 has the benefit of coming in really clutch and being lucky. Last worlds they were in a tough group relatively speaking, not the worst, but Alliance was the favorable western team coming out, and C9 were lucky and had clutch plays vs. najin.

The result has been uniformly positive with no increase of birth defects or development abnormalities.[21] A study of more than 11,000 cryopreserved human embryos had no significant effect of storage time on post-thaw survival for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or oocyte donation cycles, or for embryos frozen at the pronuclear or cleavage stages.[22] Additionally, the duration of storage did not have any significant effect on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, implantation, or live birth rate, whether from IVF or oocyte donation cycles.[22] Rather, oocyte age, survival proportion, and number of transferred embryos are predictors of pregnancy outcome.[22]\n\nSeems to be likely that both can be stored for a long time at least.

{"author":"mak6453","name":"t1_cuhk3lu","comment":"Yeah this is just plain not true..... at all. the amount of gold you've earned if you have actually done every daily would be enough to buy enough packs to have crafted several legendaries, supposing there was divine intervention to give you the worst luck in the world and not give you more than a couple legendaries in that time. \n\nThe open beta began 582 days ago. If you did the quest every day, you're getting at least 40 gold. You'll get another 10 just for getting three wins, which is often about what you need to even complete a quest. I will keep this at a bare minimum daily gold, just so we can show the worst case scenario, and say you get 50. You'd have worked up to 29,100 gold just by doing the minimum every day. That's 291 packs straight up.\n\nThe absolute minimum amount of dust you can get from a pack is 40. The average according to sources on the internet is between 86-100. If we go even lower, assuming you have the worst luck of all time, we'd say 80 dust on average. That means you at minimum received about 11,640 dust, and if you were below average you received 23,280 dust. That's enough for 7 or 14 legendaries respectively, or enough to make several of the top tier decks. Again, if you only got a few legendaries in 291 packs, that's insanely unlikely, and you'd still have 10-20 of them. Those figures don't even count the free packs from Tavern brawl or the several given out as promotional items and apologies for downtime in the game. \n\nGetting kind of sick of people saying this. It's not impossible to earn enough through 20-30 minutes of play a day to be successful at the game. At this point it's either a lack of dedication or a lack of skill that is holding you back - not your wallet.\n","created":"1440690718","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"hearthstone","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3ilqvt/c/cuhk3lu"}

{"author":"Crack-The-Skye","name":"t1_cujzlzx","comment":"My god you are full of shit. \n\n&gt; You said - explicitly - that Fred \"got people raped.\" \n\nLearn what explicitly and quotation marks mean. I never said no such thing, you are just full out making shit up. I said he stirred people up into riots, and then listed some things that happened during these riots, of which you really seem hung up on one.\n\n\n&gt; Now you're backpedaling and trying to say that he started the riots (also a dubious claim) which led to people getting raped.\n\nNo, that's basically what i said the very first time. Other than i didn't say started, i said he stirred up, which has a less absolute implication and isn't a dubious claim. You are just making more shit up.\n\n&gt;  Oh wait, hang on, you're backpedaling on that too. Now you're saying he just \"threw fuel\" on the riot which led to people getting raped.\n\nNope, you are just making up more bullshit about backpedalling. I never called him the sole cause of the riots, so it's basically rewording of the metaphorical verb. Stirred up, threw fuel, same thing. I didn't try to peg down exactly how much he caused it, I left it at \"without question started or at least threw a lot of fuel on the riot\". He did something (sure as hell wasn't neutral or diffusing to the riots), not trying to say exactly how much was his fault. People tore apart the structures and started crowd surfing on debris, he saw that and decided to hop on and start crowd surfing with them on broken pieces of the stage, and then shit really went downhill from there. Did he know he was inciting a violent riot when he did it? He claims no, and i believe him. Hence why this is a discussion about his retarded actions, not him being an ass-hole who wanted stuff to be burnt down and people raped. \n\n&gt; You're right, somebody did die at a Limp Bizkit show in Australia. She had a heart attack. Here's a photo of them[1] paying tribute to her at a later show. \n\nYes, she died of a heart attack in a hospital days later after being sent there from being crushed and asphyxiated during their concert. It was not just bad luck of someone happening to have a heart attack during their concert if that's what you are trying to imply. Once again, he's not a murderer. I'm not trying to say he is solely and personally responsible, but he did make stupid comments on stage again that were a factor. \n\n\nAnd ya, that photo is great and all, but also *totally and completely irrelevant*. So what? Are we trying to disprove that the band are a bunch of asshole who didn't care if people died during their concerts? \n\n&gt; If you're holding Fred Durst personally responsible for \"whipping the crowd up\" to the point where someone died, I hope you're doing the same for Billy Corgan and Eddie Vedder responsible too. Or maybe sometimes shit gets out of control beyond the power the people onstage have.\n\n\nI never said he personally responsible for the events, no one said he is. All I'm doing is mentioning some of the events that people call him retarded for. Stop making up shit to argue agaisnt. Yes, shit does sometime get out of hand. And when the front-man jump on debris or says stupid stuff when shit is starting to get out of hand which only further encourages it, it becomes \"ya, he probably shouldn't have done something so stupid to incite it\" rather than \"things happen at concerts\". Hence why people call him a retard, and that's not just me, I didn't start this. \n\n&gt; If you don't like Fred Durst and think he's a douche, fine. But don't make shit up and pretend like it's gospel.\n\nNever said that. All i did was mention some of the unmentioned events that had lead to others calling him a retard when someone asked. Didn't say I dislike him, didn't call him a douche. \n\n\nI wouldn't dream of infringing of your territory of making shit up.

Specifically she said that she's not sure what they have living in Brazil, but if she found a body like that near home she'd assume rats had been after it.

{"author":"Sapphidia","name":"t1_cu0gear","comment":"AST is in the same spot that Warrior was in in 2.0.\n\nThey're capable for 99% of the content, a good AST can get a party through an encounter, however a Scholar/Whitemage can both do it more easily. it only really matters on the very cutting edge stuff, but people will want an easy ride where possible and if it's \"their group\" that someone is forming, they'll probably only want to use an AST if it's either a.) their friend or b.) there arent any equal/better geared SCH/WHM around.\n\nI'm sure the ASTs will have the last laugh though. The devs know they're on the radar of needing buffs, it's just a question of when. Until then ASTs will have to weather the fact that sadly they ARE a worse healer than the other two options in a relative sense, and some party makers just feel safer with the more powerful options.\n\nThe problem isnt really unique to ASTs, it's just the nature of Party Finder stuff - a person forming a party generally has no idea of the relative ability of a person who joins unless they've played with them before. If given the choice between equally geared AST or WHM for a position, without knowing which player is more competant the WHM is the better choice. Of course, often availability of players is the key thing here, but there's no way of getting across that you're a good enough player to work round the lacking power of an AST before you join a group.\n\nFor what it's worth though, AST seems to be the strongest healer in PvP where their mana management isnt as much of an issue and their insane mobility and ability to spam cast on the run makes them stupidly strong. So at least they have a niche strength even now in their underpowered state.","created":"1439393703","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"ffxiv","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3gqcuw/c/cu0gear"}

{"author":"turtleman777","name":"t1_cu9u9ob","comment":"I think its because in your post you repeatedly complained about being falsely accused and only barely mentioned the $10 of cards you did steal. \n\nI think people are reacting negatively to your post because your story is all sad and even though you claim it isn't a sob story, you paint yourself as the victim even though you got away with and admitted to stealing cards. $10 or $1000 stealing is wrong and it ruins the community aspect of Magic.\n\nI'm sorry to be blunt, but I don't feel bad for you. I don't think many people here will. What I meant by \"shrug off\" is once you steal from one game store, you shouldn't be able to just move to another and start over. You have a reputation for being a theif because you stole. You were falsely accused for something else and that sucks, but you were  falsely accused BECAUSE you have a rep for stealing. Your reputation for stealing should and will follow you around wherever you go. But I admit, the owner spreading rumors is childish and mean.\n\nAll in all, you brought this on yourself. If you hadn't stolen those $10 of cards, you wouldn't have pissed off the owner and had been accused of stealing the Volcanic Island. Even if you had been, you would have been able to honestly say \"I have never stolen a thing in my life\" and had a clean record to back you up. All of the things you are complaining about (even the owner's petty overreacrions) is a direct result of you stealing.\n\nThe only advice I can give you is to never steal again. You wouldn't want to be stolen from, so don't steal from others (even a store). Like I said, Magic has a big community aspect, so I understand why players and especially shop owners would be hesitant to accept you.\n\nI guess just keep trying to find a place to play. Be a good member of the community and make up for your mistake and bad rep. Really the only thing you can do is try to move on.","created":"1440099917","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"magicTCG","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3hoaaq/c/cu9u9ob"}

That doesn't mean every business must be constructed like a prison and the property be as safe as a playground at Disneyland. That would be unreasonable. Let me give you an example.

{"author":"HamGynecologist","name":"t1_cugnhw1","comment":"Blizzard does advertise it as a free to play game, which it is but it just takes a lot of time to get the deck you want.\n\n[This is my solution](http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3ieu66/purchase_certain_cards_with_gold/)\n\nAllow players to buy cards with gold. Helps new players build certain decks to enjoy the game faster. Helps current players get certain cards from Classic and GvG faster. In the post they are priced so you are guaranteed average luck, yet buying a ton of packs 50+ would net you 8% more cards (Since my model is based on 100 dust pack average and the real average is 108) so buying packs is still relevant. If Blizzard wants to discount Classic and GvG packs they could lower the gold price. Lowering gold price also has the incentive compared to other forms because it cannot be abused for dust (Example: You could buy a legendary for 400 gold, extremely low price, and you could dust it for 400 dust which is below the average 108 dust per pack still). I think this is what Blizzard should do to discount previous expansions and really helps the free to play players. Even with a large discount in gold if someone wanted the majority of the cards today they would still have to buy Classic and GvG packs because gold is a pretty fixed commodity so Blizzard wouldn't lose all that much money. Win win for everyone.","created":"1440619681","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"hearthstone","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3ii9rt/c/cugnhw1"}
{"author":"synk2","name":"t1_cuc1hwa","comment":"I've got two more for you, because you started the wheels turning.\n\nLearn to communicate. It doesn't matter what field you're going into, being able to impart your knowledge to someone else is key, whether it's typing up reports, giving a presentation, meeting new coworkers and clients, or begging for money (some people call this a grant proposal). It doesn't mean you have to be a gregarious fake-smile handshaking corporate dickwad all the time, but you should know how to deal with people and how best to communicate with them. You can practice this by introducing yourself to your professors on the first day of class and routinely going to their office hours for help. You'll quickly learn they put their pants on one leg at a time, just like you.\n\nYou've been raised in a generation of texting and email and internet forums, and you'll be hiring into a workforce run by people that wrote letters by hand and got beaten for the use of 'their/there/they're'. Learn to use grammar properly, learn to spell (or spellcheck), learn to be critical of your own output, so others don't have to. It will help set you apart from people that don't. And never, ever, ever use 'lol' in a formal setting.\n\nLast one. The greatest skill anyone, anywhere, ever, can learn, is critical thinking. From the top tier of corporate business to the plains of Zimbabwe, it's key. Sadly, college only does a mediocre job of teaching this. It really will depend on your teachers. But all those word problems in high school math class that everyone hated - that's the real world. Nobody is ever going to ask you for the formula for wattage, they're going to want to know how many watts that machine you just built is going to pull. You need to be able to critically approach a real world situation and be able to convert it into a problem you can solve. This takes practice, and college is the time to practice. When you learn something, consider how it applies to other situations. When you learn something in one class, see if you can apply it in others. This will give you a holistic view of knowledge that lets you be quick and agile when dealing with applied problems. If you learn *how* to approach problems, they'll be easy to solve.","created":"1440270084","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3hzmhk/c/cuc1hwa"}

The Simpsons dropped in quality for a very long time. There was a span of about seven seasons it wasn't a great show. South Park has never had a bad season and has been great through it's entirety. I think the South Park collective library is better than the collective Simpsons library.

{"author":"trilogique","name":"t1_ctzaiu4","comment":"I posted this in another comment, but I'll respond to you as well.\n\nI don't buy this argument.\n\n[Here is all the heroes I've played on my Dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/58880824/heroes). I've played almost every single hero. Sure, I tend to favor specific ones (like anyone would), but if you look at my match history I play a different hero basically every single game and over the course of my Dota playtime I've played almost all of them (sans micro heavy heroes - not my thing). In LoL, I couldn't do this because of the paywall.\n\nPeople in Dota often play a lot of different heroes because they're available. Some people do just grind the same heroes over and over, but many people play a lot of heroes. There are modes in Dota that exist purely for variety's sake. All Random is exactly what it sounds like: everyone gets a random hero. Random Draft gives everyone 24 random heroes to pick from. Single Draft gives you 3 random heroes to pick from - 1 STR, 1 AGI, 1 INT hero. Least Played lets you only pick your least played heroes. All Random Deathmatch gives you a new hero every time you die.\n\nVariety is *encouraged* in Dota through its different game modes. If you look at my Dotabuff, I exclusively play these modes and so do a lot of other people. Why? Because to many it's a lot more fun to explore the entire hero pool.\n\n&gt;In DOTA you can straight up just lose to a counter. \n\nThis is wrong and makes you seem like you've never played Dota. You never \"straight up lose\" to a counter in Dota. Yes, counterpicks exist and it's a crucial part of drafting. It is also why Dota has more variety in competitive. However, you never lose the game because you got countered. You may lose because your draft is awful versus theirs (like picking 5 magic damage dealers into a Huskar), but that's on you and your team for not picking a better composition. \n\nDota is a game more about team play and team compositions than individual outplaying like LoL. You have to work as a team right from the draft to pick a solid lineup versus the opponent and then execute your draft. Disadvantaged drafts win all the time. It's a matter of how you play, how your team communicates and how you itemize that determines whether you win. Countering exists in Dota, but you do not \"straight up lose\" because you got countered. That's a myth.

{"author":"tek1024","name":"t1_cu3d2nj","comment":"There are seemingly two different but not opposed viewpoints at work in French - American parlance that I don't see mentioned much.\n\nIf I were French, I would be extremely proud of my rich cultural and linguistic heritage.  The language itself used to be the common denominator for communicating across the western world, particularly the educated.  Americans (perhaps) pick up on this pride and bristle, whether because they don't like their reflection and regard it as arrogance, or because of a defensive response to some perceived cultural condescension.\n\nOn the other hand, Americans are frequently \"informed\" in one way or another that, almost as a corollary to \"everyone but us\" uses metric, \"everyone in Europe speaks their mother tongue and English.\"\n\n/u/IMLOwl said:\n\n&gt;As an American, I attempt to do basic speaking in the language of the country I'm in, but if we're being fair, we're basically told that everyone in Europe speaks English and it's not that much of an exaggeration.\n\nIn grade school *and* at university I remember this frequently being the rod by which we were disciplined in language classes.  I took Spanish, French, and German, and in each case, the teacher or professor were well-traveled, in love with the country of linguistic origin, and fond of insisting in a semi-serious tone that we were uncultured barbarians unless we embraced the language the professor was teaching.  It was largely used as a motivational tool.\n\nConsequently, many Americans end up with a sneaking suspicion that if they travel to a western European country and the locals refuse to speak well-practiced English with you, it's just because they're being rude and arrogant, and are brushing you off because they don't have time to socialize with their inferiors.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.\n\n**tl;dr** French perceive affrontery and entitlement where there is none; Americans perceive deception and condescension where there is none.","created":"1439594868","avg_score":"12.0","subr":"funny","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"12","url":"http://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3gze4v/c/cu3d2nj"}

{"author":"mobyhead1","name":"t1_cul53xw","comment":"When movies were introduced, there was not a practical way to include sound. Recording technology was limited to diaphragms picking up sound waves and engraving the sound waves directly onto a drum or disc. Also, the pictures photographed onto the film occupied the entire width of the film between the two rows of sprocket holes.\n\nAbout 30 years later, it was more practical to make \"talkies.\" One way to record sound was magnetically, on a fast-moving wire (this ultimately lead to tape recording, of course). Another way to record sound was to have the signal from a microphone move a tiny mirror behind a slit, and photographing that varying light onto a piece of film.\n\nSo, when the talkies actually arrived, there was a format war between two formats where the sound was recorded onto the film (they had to make the pictures on the film slightly smaller to make space for the soundtrack) and a third sound-on-disc format, \"Vitaphone.\" A stack of phonograph records had to accompany the film print. Vitaphone lost out to one of the on-film formats because the phonograph discs could be lost, could break, and would lose synchronization with the film if a few frames of film were damaged and had to be removed.\n\nWikipedia has a good article on the subject:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film","created":"1440970245","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"explainlikeimfive","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3izq9r/c/cul53xw"}

{"author":"Oh_Hey_A_Frog","name":"t1_cu9qkx6","comment":"Sorry if this is wrong. But from my experience and what I know. The best way to level your Chocobro is to grind with him whenever you get a chance by fighting enemies of your level to get the Challenge Log entry for companions and to feed him as much as you possibly can. From my understanding, until level 12, it takes 100 Krakka Roots to gain a level and you can feed your chocobo once every hour. If you have a FC member, they can also feed your chocobo once every hour. This means that AT MOST without grinding or using the challenge log, it should take 50 hours before your bird buddy will level up. The most efficient way I think would be to complete the challenge log whenever you can (100+ enemies of your level IIRC) and make sure you feed him once every hour. Write down what time you fed it a root and then try to feed him again an hour or so later. And if you can convince your FC to feed it as well, cool. But this is pretty rough and a bit selfish unless you're willing to buy them many roots and trust that theyre actually feeding your bird and not their own with them. \n\n\nEdit: I also think there is a favorite food system as well as a boost in EXP you can get them for using certain foods. I'm not clear on this so I can't really comment other than mentioning that I've heard about it but never looked into it.

{"author":"Chicken2nite","name":"t1_cu9vyxy","comment":"If they were seriously about relaunching WCW as a brand, they could have negotiated a deal similar to other profession sports contracts where the original team that signed the contract with the talent sells that contract to another team for less money in order to recoup some of the sunk cost, which is described in [this scene from Moneyball](https://ewinsidemovies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/moneyball-script_510.jpg).\n\nWWE paid the absolutely lowest price they could get away with, but if they'd negotiated to include th existing talent contracts as well, AOL would likely have been willing to do so at a discount since these wrestlers would just be being paid to do nothing anyways, so it would save them however much they negotiate the price as being.  Vince easily could have paid half price if he wanted to, with the only remaining caveate being that most of those contracts had a much lower work load built into them than the WWF was used to running with their wrestlers.","created":"1440102442","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"SquaredCircle","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3hmoot/c/cu9vyxy"}

{"author":"three_two","name":"t1_cu9rf02","comment":"Now fight 3-4 mobs at the same time. 1 skeleton pinging you with arrows, 3 zombies with their constant attack AI. Maybe you can block the arrows with a shield but, your movement is hindered, and while you can still knockback the 3 zombies enough to avoid some damage, you're just delaying the inevitable. Holding back zombies with quick, low damage attacks only works for so long before you're surrounded. Specifically in older chunks with higher inhabited time, giving the zombies a greater chance to call reinforcements. The charged attack system as it currently is doesn't compliment the current AI for most mobs. In most games with more dynamic attack systems, mobs don't constantly attack for that very reason. Instead mobs would have different actions for different situations like rolls, strafing, backpeddling, reloading and so on.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm trying to embrace the changes/improvements but, there's no need for all these puff pieces on the current system just because Mojang gets shit on by a very vocal part of the player base. What Mojang needs is honest, critical and constructive feedback. The devs are getting walled in by a community that is polarized on the topic. One side hates the changes, and would like to see combat keep its fast paced, old-school arcade like charm. The other side is overloading on positivity towards new combat dynamics, mostly those who never excelled at the knowledge and mechanical skills necessary to succeed in it.\n\nMojang really needs to hear from a sort of middle ground of the player base. However, the voice of the middle is getting buried under two very loud, opposing sides of the argument.","created":"1440095650","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"Minecraft","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3hpsud/c/cu9rf02"}

{"author":"Twentyhundred","name":"t1_cu0a9y1","comment":"Pfffff that's a hefty one :p Hard to explain for me too, because it extends too far, beyond my comprehension because of my lack of interest in politics. And that is the main cause of this rivalry between north and south, politics. Our government keeps fucking up the whole regional government thing so badly that there's always one side of the country that's better off. Different laws apply for some things even. It really is WAY too much to type out and to elaborate on. From a general perspective that is.\n\nFrom my own experience it's pretty easy: you have assholes in the north just like you have them in the south. The mentality in the south is more relaxed and even lazy, it leans towards the French mentality but with a twist of their own. The French language they speak there and that I speak for example is not highly rated by actual French people :) But other than that, Wallonia is very nice. The people are friendly and funny, that laziness combines well with relaxed and chilled out, they have good food, great beer, beautiful landscapes and therefore, something important to me, the best driving roads in Belgium. The Ardennes are a real treat and I definitely advise you to rent a chalet for the weekend someday. There's only one spot you should not go to, and that's fucking Charleroi. Industry, migration issues, criminality, disrespectful people, etc... I'm definitely generalizing here, there have to be exceptions, like there are for everything, but if I can avoid going there, I will. It's just... not very nice.\n\nSo in short, **I** have no direct issue with the Walloons because I used to work with a lot of them and perfected my French (Belgian French) because of them, for which I am grateful, but not every region is as nice as the next one. But then again, same goes for Holland, right :) \n\nAnyway, you're welcome, it's not a big deal for me to take the time for, it's just hard to put to words these cultural differences sometimes. I haven't even spoken about prejudice and the feeling of just not liking someone's fucking face. :p ","created":"1439382358","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"pics","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3gj7q2/c/cu0a9y1"}

{"author":"gnarok","name":"t1_cttmpsx","comment":"&gt;  MMos never use to have such things as cash shops and they ran just fine long before.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, maybe even more, since then almost all mmo have a cash shop. This is even more true for F2P, B2P and P2W mmo. More rare for P2P, but WoW did it, and it worked like hell, why ? because players were asking for it, and paid for it. For the ones who have no cash shop their is something else called \"DLC\". So yeah, back in the time update were free of charge, now you pay DLC in addition of the game to get a complete game.\n\nAnd you keep saying : the consumer is being charged for stuff on top of the normal charges. Wrong and true at the same time. Player has a chance to get if for free if was playing during the event. Then, i repeat myself again, It seems you feel like you HAVE TO BUY in the cash shop, but : we DO NOT HAVE to buy in the cash shop  to play, the player is not charged of anything unless he wants to be charged for goodies he wants to get. Their is not obligation, it is not mandatory, if you don't feel like you don't have to pay more, then you have a problem.\n\nSo yes I can understand you frustration, if you like very much this game, i understand you'd like to be able to get \"all\" the cool stuff / goodies without paying any additionnal fees from your subscription, and i respect that, this is legit. But the society doesn't work like that. This is like going to cinema and pay some pop corn : why should we pay pop corn while we pay to see the movie ? Pop corn is not required to see the movie but if you want you pay some extra to enjoy the movie with pop corn. To do that you pass by the cinema cash shop. This system is use everywhere in mmo and in real life. This is marketing and customer development, this is how the society works, this is how companies growth their profits. This is a strategy to make you play the future events and store the items. This is also player rewarding, you did it, you deserve to get for free, you paid more subscritions than an other player, you support the game since more time : here is your reward : free goodies that will be charged later for others. This is also what gives motivation to some players : being able to get free stuff that other will have to pay, this can be dislike, but this cannot be blamed.\n","created":"1438874280","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"ffxiv","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3fz28u/c/cttmpsx"}

Plus, fairy GCD is different from your own so you'll cancel the fairy heals a lot if you macro it with a Stay. Plus, you remove the ability to queue your own heals for high damage situations if you make it a macro. What you should do is have your heals without any macros but have a Stay + Embrace macro so that you can direct precise Embraces when you need the Embrace to start casting before damage happens (precasting). The Stay will cancel their current Embrace and start casting the one you order.

{"author":"Wanhope","name":"t1_cu9we39","comment":"They aren't just \"Nutso\" I'm afraid. Many of them belong to private power user subs that coordinate votes and timings of posts, reposts and comments.\n\nExample, it only take a couple downvotes to doom a new posts, but it takes a few dozen upvotes to overwhelm the automatic downvotes reddit applies to keep the front page fresh. And there are pretty specific timings based on Reddit traffic that can maximize exposure to the 9-5 crowd in different regions.\n\nSo these private subs use algorithms to determine best submission times to *genuinely* trending topics (or **create** trending threads themselves), then they go any make and upvote soon-to-be top comments. Along with submitting a repost that is a guaranteed hit, upvoting it as a group in a minute and downvoting everything else around it for the next while to make sure it reaches the front page with a good lead.\n\nSo I guess they **are** nutso, but it isn't a fucking accident or luck or even sheer numbers of posts, it's calculated and they have been exposed for at least three years now...but they control a huge portion of the content so why would the admins hurt that? :/\n\nEDIT: Currently digging for it, may well be in the defunct /r/reddit.com sub, google is being uncooperative since there have been sooo many other power user fiascos in the recent years. If the post was deleted by mods since some people were probably grumpy enough to Dox all the old power users then we have to pray someone archived it. It's the same shitty people doing it with new accounts, hell more than a few people got busted for selling off their accounts to marketing companies at the same time...\n\n/u/thirdegree  has an [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3hpxbx/what_is_cool_to_be_good_at_yet_uncool_to_be/cu9yqdn) that outlines some of the activity. It's not the same people I'm referring to as the events began several years earlier, but it is one of the subs that participates in *some* of this crap.\n\n\nPeace out everyone, I'm not in the mood to argue with people about manipulating internet points *for* internet points.","created":"1440103080","avg_score":"465.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"465","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3hpxbx/c/cu9we39"}

{"author":"neemz12","name":"t1_cu862om","comment":"I worked for a financial advisor as the receptionist. They paid me a salary that worked out to barely above minimum wage and it was expected that I work my 40 hours a week and then give up 1-2 evenings to call clients and harass them to make appointments. The office was right across the street from a grocery store, and a severely mentally handicapped man who pushed carts there would walk by, and one day he just walked in. I was shocked but asked if I could help him with something, and he just walked right into our office bathroom and shut the door. My boss (the owner of the company, I refer to her as the Dragon Lady) waited outside the door for him, then proceeded to scream at the mentally handicapped guy for using our bathroom and told him if she ever saw him come near the building again she would call the cops. She then screamed at me for the next 10 minutes and told me that as the receptionist it was my job to physically stop him, no matter what it takes. So of course he coms back the next day, and I just went and told the Dragon Lady so she could stop him if she wanted, because I just could not justify it for what I was being paid, and he wasn't hurting anything.

{"author":"babblepedia","name":"t1_cu9rgun","comment":"I grew up in a really financially unstable home (mostly dire poverty, with a handful of years of middle class) where we kids could never count on the lights to come on, heat in the winter, or food in the cupboard. We were homeless five times before I turned 14. The few years that they had money, they didn't know how to live within their means and racked up $50k in credit card debt. \n\nMy grandparents were split - my paternal grandparents were extremely frugal (to the point that they'd be reality TV fodder now), and my maternal grandparents always carried huge amounts of debt. One example - my paternal grandfather was so cheap that when he had to replace the backyard fence, he pulled out each nail, hammered it straight again, and re-used it on the new fence. \n\nIn my adulthood, I've had a lot of anxiety about money. I manage it by sticking to a budget much lower than my means and saving as much as I can, so when those financial emergencies crop up, I don't have to worry so much.   And all my hobbies are about being frugal and producing something usable, like canning, thrifting, and sewing.

Watching porn together was the savior. Had to be doggy style facing the TV. Jenna Jameson saved my relationship during that time... my Ex (now) was very understanding.\n\n*Edit* Let me elaborate on my comment and know it was her idea and not mine.\n\nSo when she became visibly pregnant I was disgusted by her pregnant belly and just the pregnant look all together. I couldn't understand the pregnancy fetishes for the life of me. It most likely happened once I felt the baby kick. After that my attraction to her dropped off the map.\n\nI went to great lengths to keep this information from my now Ex. The only real give away was my erection. I even discussed going to the Dr. For viagra. Anyways this is how the conversation went.\n\nI went limp mid coitus, she asks what's wrong I just give her some bs excuse that my blood sugar is low. She says, \"you know a lot of guys have problems like this when their spouse becomes pregnant.\" I tell her that's not it, but she could tell I was lying. Anyways she walks over to the DVD player and pops in an adult movie and proceeds to play with herself. She tells me to join in when I'm ready. \n\nSo if she was having body image issues she never let me know and I tried like hell not to show that her pregnant, baby inside kicking belly freaked me the fuck out.\n\nNow down vote me to oblivion it still worked for us and a little understanding between couples goes a long ways.","created":"1439747091","avg_score":"-7.0","subr":"relationships","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"-7","url":"http://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3h6o8v/c/cu50mp6"}
{"author":"NonHomogenized","name":"t1_cu50uuo","comment":"&gt; The disagreement over GMO labelling isn't based on the scientific merits of GMO food alone as much as the American public's right to know what they're consuming and feeding their children.\n\nBut the people arguing for labeling are *still wrong* because they fundamentally misunderstand the issue.\n\n\"GMO\" as a category is not fundamentally different from \"non-GMO\" as a category in any way which is relevant on a consumer level. \"GMO\" is a statement about how something was *produced*, not what it contains. GMO corn is corn. If it is not substantially equivalent to corn in some consumer-relevant way, that already has to be labeled. For example, if they put a gene from peanuts which might trigger peanut allergies, they would have to warn people that it might trigger peanut allergies.\n\nMaking a \"GMO\" label mandatory is like making a \"handled by homosexuals during manufacturing or shipping\" label mandatory; some people don't like homosexuals, and would like to be able to support businesses that do not employ them. Should *they* be allowed to make such a label mandatory?\n\nUsing force of law to compel speech - even from a business - requires some kind of compelling interest to override freedom of speech. I'm pretty sympathetic to arguments about compelling public interest in things businesses would rather keep secret, but in this case, there is no such compelling interest: instead, the anti-GMO movement is heavily supported by the organic food lobby, which includes companies with annual revenues in the billions, who stand to profit enormously if they can make their products the de facto standard.\n\n&gt; It's up to the American people to decide whether they want to consume such products\n\nBecause you simply can't live off of the list of \"GMO free\" products you can buy. When there are, what, like 9 food crops that even have GMOs *available*. Companies are already freely *spending money* to market their products as 'GMO' free to you - including through obtaining USDA organic certification, a voluntary federal program which certifies products as, among other things, non-GMO. Why isn't that enough for you?","created":"1439747500","avg_score":"18.0","subr":"politics","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"18","url":"http://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3h74ti/c/cu50uuo"}

{"author":"icedesparten","name":"t1_ctxkyl8","comment":"Issue with just raising the minimum wage is that it doesn't fix the underlying issues, and will only result in increased prices to compensate. Stop, or significantly slow down immigration and the TFW program instead. Now before you go on about how I'm obviously a racist, hear me out. Employers want to hire people for the lowest cost possible. If there are more people looking for jobs than there are jobs in the field, then the employers can hire people for very low costs. If there are more jobs than there are people looking for them, then any employee can leave for a better job, in this case a better paying one, whenever they want. Obviously this will cause some issues of it's own, and but overall I would think the benefits to be worth it. It's certainly a better idea that increasing immigration to 1% of the total population a year, and assuming new jobs will just appear for the immigrants.","created":"1439176804","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"canada","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3georh/c/ctxkyl8"}

{"author":"AnghellicKarma","name":"t1_ctr9b6w","comment":"This one involves my girlfriend at the time. We enjoyed [geocaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTqitVK-Ts) as a hobby, and we had each found 99 caches so far. At the same time, my dad (retired), who got us into it, was over 1,000, but had never hidden any himself. So I talked with him and said, \"What if your first hide is our 100th find?\" to help create a cool milestone.  \n  \nSo we planned the whole thing, where it would be (as a general area), so that we'd be the first to find it. We met up at the town's commons and my Dad filmed us as we looked for it. My girlfriend thought it was strange, but it was my Dad, and I told her he just wanted to film it because he's just that way. I mean, he still keeps a hand-written list of everyone's Christmas gifts every year, so it wasn't *that* strange that he was filming us.  \n  \nAnyway, I let my girlfriend find the cache. Now, for those that don't know, they usually have a note and a prize for the first person that finds it. So my girlfriend unfolded the note, which said \"turn around for your prize.\" When she did, I was on one knee with an engagement ring.  \n  \nOh man, I pranked her so hard.  \n  \nOh yeah, we celebrated two years of marriage just last month.","created":"1438707164","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3frkfz/c/ctr9b6w"}

We both wish we could buy the x and then leave but feel obligated to hang out since they supplied the party supplies for the evening and are begging us to stay.  \nWe are all sitting in the living room when my BFF says he needs to go potty so he goes and I stay and the 3 of us remaining talk about our town and what we think of it.   This is when Eric's gf says,\"you know I really like this town but what I don't like about it is all the Mexicans.\"   She literally whispered the word \"Mexicans\" to make it not so awkward.  \n\nBitch, I am Mexicana.    I just smiled and nodded but as soon as BFF came out of the bathroom I told him what happened and we got the f out there.  Eric and his gf kept apologizing profusely but at that point I didn't care and my BFF Was pissed.  Totally ruined their high I'm assuming but BFF and I went to the nearest beach and looked at  glowing algae and got naked in the water.  \n\nSo the beginning was horrible but the end was amazing.

I have met people like this. There is sometimes a culture clash. For certain groups in America, going to CC is where you go if you can't get into \"real college.\" For other groups, its touted as a great option to move up in life. The clash of personalities can be sometimes interesting. Imagine if you thought you were going to a place of higher learning, where you would meet other people who want to move up in life, and you are surrounded by kids who's parents are forcing them to go, show up half the time, complain about assignments etc. \n\nTo be honest I think sometimes it would be better to take the people who actually want to be there (carrying good grades), and just let them go to the \"real university\" for free.

{"author":"Mister_Sensual","name":"t1_cul55z1","comment":"I was hanging out with my cousin in Aylmer around 11pm. We were driving back to his house when he pulled over near a park so we could wait to pick up one of his friends. A cop pulled up behind us less than 5 minutes later, lights flashing, and got out to talk to the driver (my cousin). The cop was a young guy, probably had something to prove, and he immediately started making accusations that we were drug dealers (apparently a lot of deals go down at the park). My cousin, being the chill guy that he is, stayed very polite and offered to let the cop search his car. That's when a second car pulled up and the officer told us to step out of the vehicle and place our hands on the hood. We were both handcuffed and placed in different vehicles while the cops literally tore my cousins car apart. They destroyed the rubber seals on the doors, pulled/ripped the liner out of his trunk, took the spare tire out of it's compartment and threw all the tools in there on the grass. It looked like a fucking yard sale in the park by the time they were done. Apparently, unsatisfied with not finding any drugs in the car after searching it for 20-30 minutes they began to question us about what we had been doing that night. After the usual questioning stopped they told us things like \"Ok bud, your friend already confessed. We know you guys are dealers and if you don't want to spend the night in a cell you better start talking\" They continued to question us and pulled all the stupid bullshit you can think of trying to get us to confess to something we didn't do. So finally, after about an hour of being \"questioned\" and having to listen to their awful awful Quebecer accents, they let us go. While we were putting the car back together my cousin's friend showed up, he had seen the cops from across the park and noped out because he was carrying :I","created":"1440970346","avg_score":"14.0","subr":"nottheonion","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"14","url":"http://reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/3iz8js/c/cul55z1"}

{"author":"jackelfrink","name":"t1_ctoreb6","comment":"I have quoted this so many times Im getting sick of seeing it myself, but I just have to repost this anyway. It is a quote from Martha Beck who is a professional marriage councilor .....\n\n&gt; I\u2019m a big fan of sexual monogamy, but I\u2019m puzzled by lovers who claim that their romantic partner is the only person they need in their lives or that time together is the only activity necessary for emotional fulfillment. Humans are designed to live in groups, explore ideas, and constantly learn new skills. Trying to get all this input from one person is like trying to get a full range of vitamins by eating only ice cream. When a couple believes \u201cWe must fulfill all of each other\u2019s needs,\u201d each becomes exhausted by the effort to be all things to the other and neither can develop fully as an individual.\n\n&gt; It amazes me how often my clients\u2019 significant others feel threatened when the clients revive childhood passions or take up new hobbies. I encourage people to bring their spooked spouses to a session so we can discuss their fears. The hurt partners usually come in sounding something like this: \u201cHow come you have to spend three hours a week playing tennis (or gardening or painting)? Are you saying I\u2019m not enough to keep you happy?\u201d The healthiest response to such questions is \u201cThat\u2019s right, our relationship isn\u2019t enough to make me completely happy\u2014and if I pretended it were, I\u2019d stunt my soul and poison my love for you. Ever thought about what you\u2019d like to do on your own?\u201d Sacrificing all our individual needs doesn\u2019t strengthen a relationship. Mutually supporting each other\u2019s personal growth does.","created":"1438511835","avg_score":"6.0","subr":"TumblrInAction","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"6","url":"http://reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3fh0fg/c/ctoreb6"}

I was very young so I guess I'd never seen a completely bald guy before and was staring at him. When I looked up, both of my parents were gone. I was lost, and scared. There were tons of people and I was starting to cry. I waited there for a few minutes because I thought they would come back for me but they didn't. I saw two young police officers about 30 ft away and approached them. Tears were welling in my eyes and I couldn't hardly get the words out. \"I'm lost\" I finally said to them. The one on the right looked down and laughed at me and said \"OK what do you want me to do about it kid?\" And chuckled with his buddy.  I was shocked as I was always taught that police were good people and were there to help and protect you. I don't remember what happened next, but i do remember my parents coming back for me and finding me and then arguing like \"I thought you had him\" \"no I thought YOU had him\". The game was otherwise boring.

{"author":"CromulentEmbiggener","name":"t1_cuh0hei","comment":"An old friend of mine named Devon.  He, myself, and another friend Randy were pretty close back in grade school, as close as you can be at that age when anyone who you played video games with and rode bikes with was considered a good friend.  Randy was the glue in our bunch because he was the most \"grown up\" despite being the youngest.  His dad was a businessman who was only around a few months out of the year and his mom raised him and his kid brother with a pretty hands off attitude.  As long as he was getting good grades, she'd let him do whatever he wanted, so he went out exploring his neighborhood a lot, snuck porno from his parents' collection and shared it, and was pretty fearless for an 8 year old. \n\nEventually, Randy had to move away to another state, and that kind of broke us apart because his dad had come back and was very strict.  He wouldn't let him go out much, or hang out all day with us, or do much of any of the things we used to do together.  We thought we were buddies for life but once he and his family left, we never heard from him again.  To this day I blame his dad for not being able to call us because we had a pact that we would stay friends no matter what.  \n\nDevon moved away soon after as well, but only a couple towns over, so even though we couldn't hang out (being elementary school kids and the drive was too far for our parents to take us), we kept in touch on the phone.  One day, I decided for some stupid reason to play a prank on Devon by saying that Randy called me.  He didn't of course, but for some reason I wanted to feel like Randy liked me more than him, I guess its petty childhood jealousy.  I kept that lie up for months, and the excuse I gave Devon each time he pleaded with me for Randy's phone number was based on a real incident that happened between Randy's dad and Devon's mom.  For some reason, she had called the cops on him one time, and I told Devon that Randy's dad absolutely forbade him from talking to Devon.  \n\nThe moment I realized the joke had gone too far was when Devon had his mom talk to me on the phone, begging me to tell Randy's dad that she was sorry and please let Devon and Randy be friends again.  I told her I'd do what I can but was in over my head.  I didn't know what to do or how I was going to get out of this.  Fortunately for me, my parents had some issues with phone harassment around this time and we got a new number.  I never heard from Devon again.  \n\nI've always felt bad about what I did.  If I could go back in time I'd never tell that stupid lie.  I hope that Devon eventually gave up but someday this could still backfire on me.  A couple of years ago I found Randy while randomly searching names on Facebook.  He looks well, he's married and seem to be happy.  I thought about contacting him but I chickened out.  Maybe Devon already found him and they got back together as friends.  Maybe I was really the black sheep of the group and don't deserve to bother them anymore.  So I never searched for his name again and have decided to just close that chapter for good.","created":"1440641265","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ijh59/c/cuh0hei"}

{"author":"SexualHarasmentPanda","name":"t1_cu47zgv","comment":"To start stick with a few guns, AK47 and SG for Terrorist, M4A1 and Aug for Counter Terrorists. Learn how to burst fire for medium to long range. For the AK47, try double tapping, aiming just above center mass. The second round should recoil right into the head. For the M4A1 just aim for the head with the first round and double tap.  Headshots are king in Counterstrike. If you don't kill them, don't panic, just reset your aim, wait half a second, and try again. For close range, keep in mind that the recoil climbs above your cross hair, so if you need to go full auto, drag your crosshair down their body to around knee level and your rounds should go into the chest head. Every gun has a different recoil pattern, and it wlll take time to learn them, but try to control your recoil generally like I described until then.\n\nAlso, one other tip I didn't see mentioned. Bullets go through walls(for reduced damage) in Counterstrike. The rate of penetration depends on the thickness and material of the wall, as well as the type of gun. As a general rule, Assault rifles, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, and the Desert Eagle are the best weapons to do this. If someone ducks behind a crate after taking damage, you can often guess where they are and finish them off that way. Keep that in mind when you choose your cover, and use it to your advantage when you can.","created":"1439672869","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"pcgaming","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3h2al6/c/cu47zgv"}

{"author":"CrystalElyse","name":"t1_cuc9u2m","comment":"So.... boys can't like girl things is what it boils down to? \n\nBut if a girl were to like Transformers or TMNT, would that bother you equally? What if an adult woman were to enjoy TMNT? What if an adult woman showed up at a convention dressed as April O Neil? Or if that adult woman started wearing Transformers t shirts? Would you feel disgusted? Shocked? Embarrassed for them? Feel that they were misguided? That the deck was stacked against her?\n\nChances are you wouldn't give a shit. So, what's really going on here is that you feel like \"girl stuff\" is wrong. It's gross and it's bad. It's *lesser*. \n\nAnd, really, let's look at your examples. MLP is about horses. Well, knights and cowboys have horses and neither of those are girly. It is pink and purple, yes, but those are just colors. If you saw an adult male in a purple button down shirt, you wouldn't bat an eye. It's about friendship. Well, men have friends. It has songs. Men like music. It has pegasus, unicorns, and magic. Well, so does the fantasy genre and metal music. Does this make A Game of Thrones or Iron Maiden girly and to be disliked? \n\nHell, fuck it. What if dudes WERE dressing up like Elsa, Jem, or Tinkerbell? If you saw one at a convention, you would think, \"Haha! That's hilarious!\" Because being dressed as a female character is degrading. It's a step down. But who are Elsa, Jem, and Tinkerbell? Elsa is the ruler of a kingdom, with elemental powers, that can create sentient life of snow. Well, Thor is the ruler of a kingdom with elemental powers that can create sentient life (Vision). But would a woman dressing up as male Thor be ridiculed by you? Who is Jem? Jem is a rockstar, who owns an incredibly lucrative club/bar by day, and is over the top 80s. Well, what if you saw a guy dressed as Arena Rock Axel Rose? Or David Bowie? Or a woman dressed as David Bowie? Tinkerbell is a fairy who can grant the power of flight, transport people to other worlds, she makes and fixes things as a craftsman. Well, there's no direct male equivalent to that, but it's a pretty great thing to be. Hell, anyone dressing like the Real House wives cast are fucking idiots. But still, who really gives a shit? If they like the show and idolize the women, they like the show and idolize the women. Look at Nene Leeks. Girl has made a million dollar career from that show and broken into hollywood as a real actress. She talented and an  entrepreneur. What's so bad about wanting to be like that?\n\nSo, really if you stop and THINK about it, and really look at what you're saying.... it just boils down to \"things for women are lesser and women characters are lesser and it's degrading to be in the company of womanly things, interests, and people.\"\n\nAnd that's kind of fucked up, man.","created":"1440286226","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3hys88/c/cuc9u2m"}

This could be the best thing that will happen to this kid. This is a skate ramp, which tends to minimize the risk of getting hurt compared to a direct fall, and the kid is padded up. I'm sure the father knew his son wouldn't get hurt physically. He's just teaching him to man up. I've had life experiences like this with my father, and I've also passed it on with my son, and I'm most proud when I see him do things he doubted himself capable before and take for granted now. All of it becomes water under the bridge, and I don't expect him to come up to me years later and say how much he appreciated me being hard on him, but that's exactly how I think about what my father did for me -- I don't tell him, but I'm sure he knows.","created":"1440996262","avg_score":"5.0","subr":"WTF","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"5","url":"http://reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3izgpu/c/culirfb"}

Off hand, it seems unreasonable. I don't think it's fair to say someone who commits one crime is more or less likely to commit other crimes.\n\nFor example, just because one speeds while driving doesn't mean they are likely to rape someone tomorrow. Are drunk drivers more likely to be arsonists? Are people who smoked pot 20 years ago more likely to become rapists? I know of propaganda along those lines, but it just doesn't hold up logically and turns out to not be true (I'm pretty sure...). The slippery slope argument is a fairly well proven fallacy in this context, looking at recent history.\n\nI think it's more likely we're making these people into demons that they aren't, as Americans have historically done almost constantly with regards to immigrants. It's easy to make them look bad, it's hard to sympathize with those were don't share a lot in common with.\n\nAlso, I believe many (most?) illegals in the US entered the country legally and just didn't leave.

{"author":"ceebee6","name":"t1_cu4n42r","comment":"I think you need to let your dad know about all of this, especially her suicide threats.  This should not be on your shoulders, and he needs to be prepared for how his wife is handling things.  Especially if he's not around, he may not realize how bad it's gotten.  Tell him everything, and mention to him about how your mom needs to see a therapist to help with the transition and to get her meds re-evaluated.  That leads me to another thought...  is she taking medication for her depression?\n\nAlso:  If she does start talking about suicide again, you can take her to the hospital to the behavioral health emergency part of the hospital.  My friend just had to do that for her sister, and while it may seem 'dramatic', often it's the best response to get the person the help they need.\n\nAs for how to help your mom cope with you moving off to college...  I don't think there's much more you can do than what you are already doing.  You could plan a weekly phone call with her (or, a couple times a week) so that at least she knows that every Monday at 2pm or whatever you and she will talk.  But honestly, you can't fix your mom's depression or her choices to not develop any interests outside of you.  Yes, it's going to be rough for her--but that's something she needs to sort out with a therapist, not her teenage daughter.","created":"1439706731","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"relationships","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3h6dld/c/cu4n42r"}

{"author":"lessmiserables","name":"t1_ctr08ls","comment":"There are a few factors at play.\n\n1. Unemployment and, more important, underemployment are still quite high. Wages won't increase much if companies and workera know that there are dozens, of not hundreds, of workers who are willing to take the job for the aame or less money. High rates of immigration doesn't help.\n\n2. People ARE being compensated more, but the compensation is in the form of higher health care costs nstead of actual wages. Employers still have to pay that and it's considered part of labor costs. Whatever you think of the ACA, it undoubtedly has made health care more expensive for employers.\n\n3. Because of the points above, technology has replaced a lot of labor. Companies can get more work out of the same cost of labor.\n\nThis last point will generally answer your question: the economy is doing well because companies have become more efficient. This doesn't necessarily mean thay wages are doing well. \n\nThis is also nothing new. Recoveries are often like this: companies react to a recession by cutting staff, then they use technology to improve as the economy starts back up, and eventually will hire again as things get better. Then the lavor market gets tight and wage increase. It's the business cycle and not really all that surprising.

{"author":"fuzzyBlueMonkey","name":"t1_cuibvqu","comment":"The language bothers me since words have meaning.   With such ambiguous use of language, I have to assume the author is trying to mislead people.   To be accurate people can and are regularly killed 'with' fists, feet, hammers, 2x4's, large rocks, knives, or firearms rather than 'by' them.   Dying \u201cfrom guns\u201d is just as misleading.   People die from diseases, lack of oxygen, blood loss, etc.   \n\nThe closest he get\u2019s to an actual comparison is the use of the term \u201cgun violence.\u201d   Violence is somewhat associated with \u2018intention\u2019 vs. \u2018accident.\u2019   Intention and accidents involve human action.   He also mentions \u2018gun-related\u2019 at one point, but mixed in with every other term it all becomes largely fiction before he even starts doing the math.   In almost the next line he\u2019s referring to deaths \u2018caused by firearms.\u2019   \n\nAs a comparison, when was the last time you read an article about people killed \u2018by\u2019 cars?  We\u2019re pretty clear these days about drivers under the influence, those that are over fatigued, speeding or otherwise driving distracted.   There\u2019s a lot of discussion today about the effect of texting and driving or even just talking on a phone.   Few calls to ban cars or tally all \u2018car deaths\u2019 as a method of convincing the uninvolved of the inherent danger of 4,000 pound monsters hurtling down the road at 70mph.   So we\u2019re clear that people driving cars cause injuries.   The exception to this are cases where a vehicle is defective and fails to operate safely (think GM).   Even in those cases, we\u2019re unlikely to say the car caused the death, but would properly identify the defect or manufacturers error as the cause.","created":"1440738057","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"politics","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3inupe/c/cuibvqu"}

This include all casino games, lottery, any form of betting (boxing, horse races etc.). In gambling your expected value is always negative. Play long enough and you will lose money.\n\nIn stock markets you don\u2019t have a house that sets the odds. You can set the odds as you desire and choose a price that you are willing to buy/sell. Because of this stocks have always positive expected value. Even when markets really plummet and hit rock bottom, stocks have positive expected value.

But to say that you are taking a company to court, because their product was used in a malicious and criminal manner... I just don't see the math there. I mean do mob widows sue Louisville Slugger?

Dinner isn't a great idea, since if you (or she) realizes it's not going to happen you may wind up waiting for and eating a meal when you'd rather be leaving.\n\nMeet for drinks or coffee or something like that.

{"author":"atinyradish","name":"t1_cu9w1a3","comment":"I was actually laughing after reading that. It's above average in size. That has to be a joke. And being a big athletic dude is not a guarantee of a big dick. The tallest most muscular guy I ever had sex with had a 3.5\" penis. The shortest more thin guy had a 5.5\" penis. I once dated a guy who was 5'11\" and 120 pounds with a thick 6.5\" penis. Another guy was 5'10\" and 190 pounds (a bit overweight) with a 4\" penis. Even another was 5'7\" and about 145 pounds with a thick 7\" penis (way too big for me actually, the sex was simply painful).\n\n\nAll of this is just to say, your body size is not necessarily indicative of your penis size. Plenty of short thin dudes have giant dongs, and plenty of tall athletic guys have tiny peens. \n\n\nAlso, I agree. Most likely a joke. Especially if that's the size of his dick. Most girls would not make fun of a teeny peen to a guy with an actually small penis. We would only do that when the guy is *obviously* not small, as we'd assume he'd get the joke. But, as this shows, making small penis jokes is just a bad path to go down. \n\n\nRemember: only big dick jokes to guys with big dicks. The only way to avoid insecurity issues.","created":"1440102538","avg_score":"78.0","subr":"relationships","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"78","url":"http://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hqmfa/c/cu9w1a3"}

{"author":"neuroguy","name":"t1_cubldt5","comment":"It has been proposed that one function of the hippocampus is that of a comparator. A comparator in this case is a theoretical mechanism that compares new sensory inputs with previous memory. Here is an old paper on it, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11732710\n\nAlso, there is a lot of work that suggests the hippocampus plays an important role in match/mismatch responding. That is, responding correctly to a new stimulus vs an old stimulus. \n\nThis all is quite sensible considering the role of the hippocampus in consolidation of memory. Hypothetically, the hippocampus needs to consolidate new information in a way that does not conflict with memory already stored or disrupt expression of prior memory. Therefore, a comparator function seems inherently necessary. Moreover, the hippocampus likely is critically involved in ambiguous conflict situations, in which match/mismatch processing is more strongly engaged.\n\nhttp://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/6/2226.full","created":"1440226452","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"science","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/science/comments/3hs7r7/c/cubldt5"}

I really didn't get anything out of the game until now but it's already too late. Judging from everyone's posts, people have made up their minds.

You can hit minions from the opposite side of the lane from the brush, leaving his stealth with much to be desired. \n\nAnd maybe let his W make him stealth immediately in brush, kind of like Miss Fortune's W changes.

{"author":"ccm200","name":"t1_cu9wkaz","comment":"Yes. Well this is something that we saw coming. It's done, finally ! We can move on. That's a good thing, it was becoming quite tiring. \n\nStill I have to say I agree with a lot of the things he said to defend himself:\n\n- Marine Le Pen did not attend this meeting. \n\nShe's the President of the party and aspires to be the President of France. She's been planning this eviction for years and ... when it's finally time to do it she's not here. It's too easy. It doesn't really make sense to me. It's coward IMO. \n\n(During the debate about gay marriage, that lasted for months and months, and *is* an important issue ... she refused to give her opinion. Well : is she gonna remain silent on all controversial matters? Cause that's not what I look for in a politician, and that doesn't really fit with her: \"I'm not afraid to tell people what I think, I don't lie like all the others, I don't hide any agenda...\")\n\nThe majority of the Front National electors support Jean-Marie Le Pen's eviction : the party asked them a few weeks ago and more than 90% said they wanted him to leave.... Why doesn't she have the courage to show up and take part in the decision, why? \n\nThe reason is that she wants to keep her image as clean as possible. She wants to appear \"above all this drama\", presidential, a good candidate for the regional elections in December... Well: whom does she think she's fooling with this strategy? It's not like it's an anecdotal crisis, it's been present in the french media for 3 decades! He's his father, it's a politico-familial soap opera in which she's the leading role! I just don't understand how she thinks it doesn't make her seem coward. She should have had the balls to openly and proudly say \"yes, finally, after all these years, I know it took me way too long but now I'm ready to evict him!\" and hear the vast majority of french people - including her FN supporters- clap! And take a bow. But no: she didn't choose to do that. \n\n- Marine Le Pen knew what the FN represented, which ideas it holds, when she was elected president of the party in 2012.\n\nHis \"detail of history\" remark has been reiterated several times in the past 30 years. It was not a surprise. That's what the party she accepted to run for represents. \n\n- Jean-Marie Le Pen claims that this vote was not legit: that they didn't even hold a real vote: two members (the only ones who were in his favour) say they were not present during the final deliberation.\n\nWhich may lead to another court battle, which he may win again. He says \"It just goes to show how Marine Le Pen keeps on acting the same way, without respecting justice decisions: it gives people a good idea of what she would do if she was leading the country\". And, even if he's being dramatic and theatrical, he's not wrong here either.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo is that finally it or will the soap opera run for another season in September?\n\nAt the beginning of september there will be a FN Congress in Marseille, where Jean-Marie is popular. He will come, that's for sure. \n\nIn december there are regional elections. Marine le Pen is a candidate is the north: she would like to put an end to all this as quickly as possible so that her campaign is not 'polluted'. Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen - Marine 's niece and Jean-Marie's granddaughter 'stole' her granddad's place in the south, where she is running, instead of him. He criticised her. But he just announced tonight that he won't run against her (it was rumored that he would be an independent candidate and try to ruin her campaign. Finally not).\n\n","created":"1440103339","avg_score":"14.0","subr":"europe","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"14","url":"http://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hr1wp/c/cu9wkaz"}

That type of thinking is limited to a small subsection of the population, a group who (unsurprisingly) have a tendency to become scientists and be interested in what scientists have to say. You might not be friends with people who don't. When you do interact with them, you might be disinclined to take them seriously, and you might be inclined to dismiss their opinions.\n\nMost people think [defensively](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/). If they are told \"X is wrong\" and X suits their prejudices, they will double-down on it and believe even harder.\n\nLike you, they are also subject to the \"everybody applies the same reasoning process that I do\" error. Very few people are not. Even those who are fully aware of the vast differences in human reasoning styles, still have to actively recall that knowledge before acting on it.\n","created":"1439058338","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"science","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/science/comments/3g8l2h/c/ctw4271"}

{"author":"financeaccount1234","name":"t1_cu3fc9x","comment":"Your number of open accounts is weighted 10% (compared to average age of accounts at 15%), which is pretty significant.  Maximum score contribution on this factor is obtained at 20 open credit lines (including mortgage, car payment, personal loans, and any other form of credit) with 2-3 different types of credit (card+house, card+student loan, etc.).\n\nIf you want a really high score (and you should), it's good to get up to at least 10-15 open credit lines assuming you can be responsible and not use it up just because it is there then be unable to pay stuff off.  No fee annual cards are great, free ways to have lots of open credit accounts that age without any cost to you.\n\nDon't pay attention to people telling you not to worry about your score.  Getting a super high score saves you tens of thousands of dollars on a home mortgage for starters and actually is worth much more than that (/r/churning).  It's possible to make more money for free from good credit than the average American household does from working.  It's HUGELY important to maximize your credit score.  Having one card and paying it off on time will not get you there.  You're doing the right thing paying attention to the details.","created":"1439599184","avg_score":"0.0","subr":"personalfinance","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"0","url":"http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3h0bo8/c/cu3fc9x"}

{"author":"TheSupremeAdmiral","name":"t1_cu9wdgm","comment":"It's hard to say, because there doesn't seem to be any real downsides to simply giving players the choice to play how they want. When I think about my misgivings I think it has to do with seeing games as \"art.\" There is a term [Gesamtkunstwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk) that refers to a piece where every single aspect of it contributes to the art as a whole. The visuals, the soundtrack, the way the dialogue is worded, the gameplay mechanics, controls, the way the UI looks, the difficulty, everything in the game should be contributing to the \"art\" that is experiencing the game itself. Not many pieces of art can be described this way. A Gesamtkunstwerk means a perfect piece. Making it so players can simply choose to turn off mechanics seems to ruin the integrity of the Gesamtkunstwerk, at least for Darkest Dungeon. Another game might make mechanical choices an integral part of the experience, but Darkest Dungeon is supposed to be about \"making the most of a bad situation.\" It reminds you of that every time you turn on the game. \"Quests will fail or must be abandoned. Heroes will die. And when they die, they stay dead.\"\n\nI'll concede that DD is more than a piece of art, it's also a product. The way the game is, alienates a lot of players and keeps them from enjoying the product they bought. Having players choose is a very practical solution. It seemingly fixes all of the problems. Hardcore enthusiasts can enjoy the game as the creators envisioned it, and other players can turn that off for a less tedious experience.\n\nBut the way that I see it is this: Gesamtkunstwerk means perfection, in the most literal sense. The perfect experience shouldn't need options like that, it shouldn't matter. It's perfect how it is. I don't know how to describe this any better. Many people will disagree with me and point out how ridiculously pretentious this idea of \"integrity\" is. I thank you for asking about my views so politely.

A disproportionate amount of the maltreatment cops dish out is directed towards people of color.\n\n&gt; I am distressed at the way the media is controlling everyone's mind lately.\n\nOnly Fox News controls peoples' minds. No other news organization has so many gullible viewers.\n\n&gt; Isn't it the same attitude as a racist taking the view that all black people are bad?\n\nThere's some merit in that question. The problem is, too many cops _are_ racists and seem to believe that all black people _are_ bad. That's why you're lately waking up to the news that people see all cops as bad.\n\n&gt; unintentionally are keeping racism alive in this country by pointing it out so much.\n\nI understand your point of view; I see it on Fox videos a lot.

{"author":"thelittlegreycells","name":"t1_cu0g13i","comment":"If you want to relax for a bit you can go to the Vondelpark, just find a spot on the grass and relax. \n\nAnother cool museum is the Amsterdam Museum, there is a lot of info about the city itself and how it came to be. \n\nIf you are walking through the big main shopping street, called the Kalverstraat, and you're coming from the direction of Damsquare you should look out for a small church wedged between the shops on your right hand, because it's a church called [de Papgaai (the Parrot).](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//H.H.+Petrus+en+Pauluskerk+%28Papegaai%29/@52.3703001,4.8956913,17z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c609c126dfd1ed:0xe8e94cea7895a1b7!2m2!1d4.8917983!2d52.3712338?hl=nl) It doesn't look all that much from the outside but once you get inside it's kinda big and cool. I think it was build like this because it was a catholic church and during the Dutch reformation we got kinda overzealous and started smashing everything catholic. Fun times.\n\nFurther down the Kalverstraat, you can go into something called [het Begijnhof](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Begijnhof/@52.3695723,4.890108,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x6cccf0d68d002e9c), it's an old inner courtyard that is right in the middle of the busy city but is really calm, like an oasis of piece. The houses there are really pretty.\n\nIf you are looked for cheap food, behind the Leidseplein, at [the Leidsekruisstraat](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Leidsekruisstraat,+1017+Amsterdam/@52.3636123,4.88511,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c609e910a1f18d:0x1b83a4addcc97133) there are a couple of cheap Italian places where you can eat any pizza for 5 euro. If you are looking for real Dutch food, there is a place called [Haesje Claes](http://www.haesjeclaes.nl/?language=en_EN), which serves old fashioned Dutch cuisine. It is a bit more expensive though.\n\nAs for nightlife, I studied in Amsterdam, so I went to a lot of student bars and squatters bars, and they are nice if you like that kind of scene. I just went cause the drinks were cheap. [The Minds](http://www.theminds.nl/) is near the Dam square and an old squatter bar I used to frequent.\n\nOh and don't buy bottled water in tourists shops for 1 euro. There are Albert Heijns (big chain supermarket) everywhere, like behind the Dam, on Museumplein and like on so many more places. You can buy cheap water there and snacks and bread and whatever. Those tiny tourist supermarkets are always ripping you off. \n\nThere are a million things more you can do, if you want to know something specifically, just ask.

So you can see how it'll lessen decent paying jobs and put pressure on small businesses in one go while lining the pockets of big companies. Which I don't have a problem with, they are in the business of making money. But I do have a problem if the rules are tailored in a way that money comes from the pockets of those who earned it.

If the location was netting even 10k/yr, she would probably just hold on to it.  You will probably need to put a lot of work into it to get it profitable and low maintenance. Ask yourself if you'd feel comfortable low-balling her offer of the business to have a chance at making the investment work.  If you aren't, you probably shouldn't buy it at all.  That's why family/investments don't mix well.

It's a college town, so she assumes some kids are just having a rowdy party.\n\nThe next day, she sees in the news, a woman was attacked in her apartment, nearly raped, but luckily a roommate was home.

The whole point of resetting the timeline was so that they could bring back characters that had been killed prior to those events (Cyclops, Jean Grey/Phoenix, etc.) for the Apocalypse movie.

{"author":"Xedapnub","name":"t1_ctqwgxi","comment":"I mean if you really wanted to hear my opinion on this you could've just begged me, pleb. ;)\n\nFor starters I'd like to relay a bit of information that's probably bloody obvious but who knows eh? Claiming something is better based solely on the number of consumers is the ultimate fallacy. If you'd any wits you'd refrain from utilising it. Furthermore I'm not the one with the burden of proof to disprove a positive that wasn't well established to begin with. \n\nIn saying this I'd merely outline some things:\n\n- Gameplay is entirely subjective. Regardless of which design you prefer it is well established that both games have the most well rounded characters and items that are the most balanced in comparison to the rest of the genre.\n\n- The client and features within is arguably a good place to start. Looking at the core of the games one can no doubt see that LoL lacks a lot of basic features that Dota 2 (&amp; Reborn) possess and many more such as voice chat, replays, ingame-tournament spectating, a sandbox mode and a full screen option.\n\n- The engine of Dota 2 (Source 2*) is far more powerful and projects better graphics, loads faster in general and has enabled full custom game/map support.\n\n- Dota 2's pricing is exceptional even compared to LoL's. The former does not arbitrarily restrict content like Runes and grants players a grind-free character pool available right from the start.\n\nThese are examples that crush your silly \"we haz moar players\" pseudo-argument.","created":"1438676918","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"leagueoflegends","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fonyt/c/ctqwgxi"}

{"author":"City_of_Orphalese","name":"t1_ctp78ti","comment":"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Dota, is in fact, the mod for Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne, Defense of the Ancients, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Dota, the mod for WC3. Dota is not an game system unto itself, but rather another free mod of a fully functioning game system made useful by the Blizzard corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full game as defined by Webster's Dictionary.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the Warcraft 3 system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Warcraft 3 which is widely used today is often called Dota, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Warcraft 3 system, developed by the Blizzard Entertainment Project.\n\nThere really is a Dota, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the larger game they use. Warcraft 3 is the kernel: the program in the engine that allocates the machine's resources to the other mods that you run. The kernal is an essential part of an engine, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete game. Dota is normally used in combination with the Warcraft 3 operating system: the whole system is basically Warcraft with Dota added, or the mod for Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne, Defense of the Ancients. All the so-called Dota derivations are really derivations of Warcraft 3.

He never really had any relationships, and this is why we thought he was doing this. We tried so hard, getting him blind dates, double dates, slutty dates. He would tell us that that things just never worked out, or she didnt like him, ect.  \n\nAnd its not like we wouldn't have accepted him, we had a gay roommate, and he knew this.

Men with primary custody are less likely to press the issue in court. There is actually very little the court can actually do to make someone support their children.

I'm not sure if you have ever shared her feeling (even in a smaller sense) but if you think about the possibility of her getting bored with you, falling in love with someone else, or just falling out of love with you in general... you'll see where she's coming from. \n\nWhat I would suggest is talking to her. Tell her you're thinking a lot about what she wrote to you, tell her that it's bothering you because you can't imagine those things happening, but you should acknowledge that the possibility of your relationship changing with time could happen. I would suggest also reminding her of all the good things that come with a changing relationship, how things will inevitably be different after marriage, 10+ years together, and if you have children- but you can also tell her that those things are good. That you look forward to a life with her, normalcy with her, changing with her etc., and that you don't want to become a complacently unhappy married couple. You probably will have to work at your relationship to make sure that the feelings you have now remain like they are today, but that's okay. No relationship is effortlessly perfect, and it might be helpful for her to hear you talk about that? \n\nI don't know you personally, but I hope this helps. It's a difficult conversation to have and to reassure her that things will be okay even if you don't know the exact plan of your future. Good luck :) ","created":"1439429170","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"relationships","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gs51b/c/cu13fh2"}

I'm not trying to single you out. I've just noticed this growing simplification around here of the \"anti-SJW\" crowd (I don't know what else to call them) to nothing but racists and misogynists. There's definitely a problem with racism and misogyny in that crowd, but there's a lot more to it than just that. It's like the Tea Party in the US- racism is definitely a part of it, but you can't reduce it to just racism.

Meanwhile, there are many other cards without 0% intro that would give you $500-$2,000 of value for meeting the same requirements. Therefore, the 0% is not really 0% when you factor in opportunity costs.\n\nFor example, the Amex Premier Rewards Gold will give you a minimum of $700 of value with annual fee waived and only $1,000 minimum spending in 90 days.

{"author":"Mr_Facepalm","name":"t1_cuf8a1v","comment":"&gt;your wife is an adult, why cant she lead herself\n\nThe Bible tells me to, so I need to.\n\n&gt;this says nothing about the real world, only says what the bible believes, which most people do not think that marrying a divorced woman is a sin\n\nWe are talking about what the Bible says, not what the world says.  This is not the only place where the world behaves in an immoral fashion.  There are plenty of sins that \"most people\" don't care about.\n\n&gt;Jesus condemns all divorces without exception. But in this verse, Jesus says that divorce is permissible when the wife is guilty of fornication. But what if the husband is unfaithful? Jesus doesn't seem to care about that.\n\nI think it is fair to take away that a wife can divorce her husband for fornication as well.  Jesus was often speaking specifically to men, so he addressed them directly.\n\n&gt; Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward.\n\nI've already talked about pretty much this exact thing.  That's taken out of context, and that interpretation contradicts other places.  You need to be willing to give those things up in order to follow Christ.\n\n&gt;Luke (2:23) \"Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.\"\n\n&gt;Not women\n\nYeah.  That's directly quoting from the Old Testament.  The firstborn, in the biblical sense, was always male.\n\n&gt;Romans 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; \n\n&gt;Paul explains that \"the natural use\" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men.\n\nWow, that's intentional bad interpretation.  Just read where Paul tells husbands how to treat their wives.  Paul obviously highly values women.  And when you think about how badly women were treated those days, Paul and Jesus seemed extremely *liberal* in how they instructed people to treat women.  Jesus talking to the Samaritan woman at the well was socially unacceptable, but he treated her better than anybody else would.\n\nYou know good and well this passage is saying heterosexual desires are natural and homosexual desires are unnatural.\n\n&gt;Ephesians 5 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n\n&gt;Wives must submit to their husbands \"in every thing\" as though they were Christ. \"For the husband is the head of the wife.\"\n\n&gt;this is also cemented in Colossians 3:18\n\n&gt;Wives must submit to their husbands \"in every thing\" as though they were Christ. \"For the husband is the head of the wife.\" \n\nRight.  I already talked about that.  That is the order that was implemented from creation.  A wife's job to her husband is a help mate who submits to, respects, and honors her husband.  A husband's job to his wife is a protector and provider who loves her and gives his life in service and care for her.","created":"1440521386","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3haxqo/c/cuf8a1v"}

The problem is he bought it in Betamax, a tape video format that went up against VHS in the 1980s and 1990s. Betamax lost the fight and it is extremely rare that anyone would still have a Betamax player anymore, except collectors who believe that Beta was a superior format because it could produce higher quality images.

{"author":"frenchcherry","name":"t1_cuk6djm","comment":"Business was slow these days. Godric hadn't seen a customer walk through his sturdy, granite doors in more than a month. I suppose the elimination of the Dark Wizard Drogon had something to do with it. The people of Aberon were finally at peace after more than a decade of abuse. As a private detective, this climate did not bode well for Godric. It was just as well. He was almost two hundred years old, an impressive age for a dwarf. It was a good time to retire. \n\nGodric reclined in his chair, stein in hand about to take a sip when he heard a light tapping at the stone door. He hesitated. Was it his imagination? Perhaps it was only a bird. The tapping came again. This time, Godric responded. \u201cThe door is unlocked. You may enter if you wish.\u201d\n\nThe door slowly opened ajar and a tall, fair maiden entered. She timidly walked to his long oak desk and pushed her light blonde hair behind her pointed ear. \u201cUm, sir...\u201d\n\n\u201cHrmmph,\u201d Godric grunted. This maiden looked nothing like his regular customers. She was light and delicate, as if the wind could blow her away. He wouldn't be surprised if her request involved escorting her across the street so she wouldn't float off. \n\n\u201cI came here to request your aid...\u201d She rubbed her thin hands and stared down nervously. \u201cI mean to say, I have heard that you are a great detective, and I believe this case would be of particular interest to you, not that your other cases would not be interesting...\u201d\n\nGodric grew tired of her rambling. He wished to retire to bed early, and so mumbled, \u201cIt is getting late. If you wish to provide a case for me, please write down all pertinent information on this piece of parchment and I will peruse it in the morning.\u201d \n\nHe began to stand when the maiden blurted, \u201cMr. Stormbeard, please listen!\u201d \n\nHer exclamation surprised him, not simply because of her sudden outburst but because of the content. \u201cHow do you know that name?!\u201d He roared. \n\nShe stepped back, startled. She ignored his question. \u201cIt's about your son.... They took him. \u201d\n\nRealization dawned on Godric. Those many years he spent under a pseudonym, far from home, hoping that they would not find him and his family were for naught. His past had caught up with him. He slammed the stein on his desk, dripping cold ale onto the dark oak. \u201cTorag! Of course they did. They couldn't just leave us alone.\u201d He stared down silently ruminating on this information. \n\nThe elven maiden added quietly, \u201cThe last I heard the Knights were taking him to Mazon.\u201d\n\nGodric took a deep breath and let it out, disturbing his long, orange beard. \u201cFine. I will go seek him,\u201d he determined. \n\nThe woman's eyes lit up. \u201cOh thank you! Thank you! I knew you would help! Rogar always was talking about how grand a detective you are, and I know that with your determination you will undoubtedly find my husband. Not like those other human detect-\u201d\n\n\u201cHUSBAND?!?!\u201d","created":"1440889455","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"WritingPrompts","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3ivt39/c/cuk6djm"}

{"author":"PrimordialPericulum","name":"t1_ctrdskc","comment":"1. Think of it this way. Say someone notorious. Let's uhh make another example, Winslow Lawbringer, a Warrior on let's say uhh.....on the Hyperion server (No offense to anyone). He's notorious for having parse information in his groups and he's also notorious for belittling people for that information. People come out of his parties complaining ALL the time. Word spreads like wildfire to Linkshells and FC's. \"Oh this guy is using parse info to kick people from his parties in a malicious manner.\"  What is the solution to this?\n\nA) Don't join his parties AFTER you've been belittled.\nB) Join is party and make him eat his own DPS requirement for lunch.\nC) After being kicked, run to a GM with your tail between your legs.\nD) Spread the word of his malicious behavior to publicly shame him and keep people from joining his parties.\n\n2. If Joe Bean joins a PF with a No Bonus, then that's his fault entirely.  He should've joined a learning group. That's a gimme. It's just common sense at that point. But if the group is straight up slandering him, calling him names or being like the following.\n\n\"Stupid fucking noob. You should've read the PF, dumbass.\" \n\"Get the fuck out of the party you piece of shit. You wasted everyone's time.\"\n\"Stupid ass leeching noob.\" \n\nIf people are like that, then yeah that is harassment. But if people are like the following.\n\n\"Joe Bean didn't clear this.\" \n\"It's Joe Bean. He doesn't have the achievement.\" \n\"Joe, you gotta leave man. This isn't a learning group.\" \n\nBecause let's be real here there are 2 kinds of parties. One's that are lenient towards people like Joe Bean and the other who just don't give a shit. The problem with the parse information being in PF (IN MY OPINION) is it's going to breed a lot of animosity and tension between players. Even if they're geared, even if they're good. There is always going to be that asshole that goes, \"I'm top DPS. Suck my dick.\" Which is then going to lead into a downward spiral.\n\nA parser is a glorified calculator, it is not a tool meant to belittle/berate people as individuals. When you use a parser for this you are being nothing but a certified elitist and an asshole and let me tell you something. You don't need to be an elitist or need a parser to be an asshole.

My biggest issue when I'm a support is I don't know how to optimally ward riv/drag or sometimes even lane bush, I feel like we lose lane pressure or I trade half my hp for the vision. There are definitely more optimal times to ward than when I ward. Also if there is a simple way to guess how long teams will take to take objectives if there is no surrounding wards to help you guess. I don't know about other people, but this would help me most and I would watch the shit out of those videos.

Out of state is considerably more expensive. So make sure you understand how much tuition is and plan accordingly. FIll out your FAFSA if you need financial aid. \n\nNext you want to choose a few schools and look at their admission requirements and deadlines. \n\nThe best thing to do is to find someone who has a master's in public health and ask them questions like what did you need to get into your program are there any accreditations that are essential for that? or for an MBA. \n\n\nTypical general stuff you will need: \n\nResume or CV\n\nPersonal statement\n\nTranscripts from each academic institution beyond high school (international transcripts must be evaluated by a credentialing agency, ie. WES)\n\nGRE, MCAT, GMAT, or LSAT scores\n\n\nThree recommendation letters (forms provided in application materials)\n\nNon-refundable application fee\n\n\nMake sure someone reviews all of this and edits it for you so there are NO mistakes or spelling errors. \n\n\nYou want to get recommendation letters from past professors or places of work, make sure they know what you need it for. Get a few copies from each one so you have some extra. \n\nIf you would like you can PM me and I can give you resources personal to you but I'd need info.

{"author":"Sipricy","name":"t1_ctw4j70","comment":"&gt; I think the \"high skill ceiling\" argument that defenders of the patron deck trot out is a weak argument.\n\nWell, you would be wrong, then. The deck has a high skill floor, too. You have to be able to survive until turn 7 at the very least. Generally you'll need to live past that. If you've ever played the deck, you'd realize that this deck is actually difficult to play. There's a reason why players in low tiers don't tend to play the deck, or if they do, they're very bad with it. It's a combo deck, so by nature, it's already more difficult to play. It's not aggro, where you play your minions and go face or make efficient trades. It's not Midrange, where you just play on curve. You have to look at your huge hand and always be thinking about the different things you could be doing that turn and the next. You have to set yourself up for your combo, and to do that, you're going to need to draw lots of cards, hopefully without overdrawing. Yes, the draw engine can be strong, but isn't always. The combos aren't as consistent as you think they are. If you're having trouble against Patron Warrior, play Midrange Hunter. Pressure them every single turn, and see how easy it is to dismantle them when they don't draw a perfect hand, especially when the player piloting the deck isn't very good. There's a reason why tons of players that are actually good at the game consider this deck to be difficult to play.","created":"1439059236","avg_score":"0.0","subr":"hearthstone","controversiality":"1","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"0","url":"http://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3g94an/c/ctw4j70"}

{"author":"godfuckingdarnit","name":"t1_cuca2cm","comment":"&gt; The issue is whether Genesis 1 and 2 is meant to conform to modern concerns about journalistic history or if it has a different meaning.\n\nTo be clear, this is actually only a small part of the issue - namely it's one example that I won't comment on as I don't have the requisite historical knowledge. That is why I'm talking about religious claims more broadly - whether Genesis is allegorical or not, there are plenty of *other* supernatural religious claims that really are intended to be taken as properly, actually true. For the most part, Muslims really do truly believe and insist that Muhammad spoke to an archangel. The majority of Christians really do sincerely believe that Jesus was immaculately conceived, and later rose from the dead. \n\nThese are examples that would be extremely difficult to argue as allegory. Some people are beginning to interpret them that way, and that is progress of a kind. But again, it is not honest to suggest that this was always the intention, or that this is the default state of religion. Neither history, nor any recent stats about what religious people actually believe, will back that up. \n\n&gt; To be totally elementary, if I were to say that it's raining cats and dogs and you said that since it's not literally raining cats and dogs (let's hope not, at least), my statement is wrong, I'd think you were a little off.\n\nOf course the obvious difference here is both the speaker and listener have a common understanding that this is not meant to be taken as a literal statement. To repeat (ad nauseam), *this is not what religion does*. In some cases, sure, but not as a general rule. It is about what is actually believed about reality. \n\nReligion really does make all kinds of unsupported claims about reality, and it really does praise belief in those claims as virtuous. It is honestly quite foolish to pretend that isn't the case. If you're able to kid yourself about it, good luck to you. But don't expect it to impress anyone who actually cares about what is true.\n\n&gt; He has a good book, unfortunately-titled by the publisher, Atheist Delusions: The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies[1] . \n\nThere never was a dog who praised his fleas. I'm not interested in these writers piggybacking on the success of some modern atheist writers. There are hundreds of them, and they are yet to put the tiniest dent in people like Dawkins or Dennetts credibility. They only appeal to people who are already sincere believers - or perhaps those who may not believe but still hold 'belief in belief', which is the idea that even if religion isn't *true*, the act of believing is still somehow a good thing - a very condescending notion indeed ('faith may not be necessary for us educated, intellectual types - but those rabble, those plebs, they still need it..'). \n\nI am concerned with what is actually true. I'm not interested in those who would deliberately obfuscate truth to prop up some other ideology. If religion was only ever sold and bought as allegory, there wouldn't be a problem. But that is clearly, demonstrably, obviously not the case.\n\n&gt; I would love it if we had a good critic like Nietzsche around still. At least he's challenging.\n\nMeh, haven't read him for a long time but from memory he contradicts himself every second page. And he was horrifically conservative, even for his time, on things like womens rights. Not a fan.\n\n&gt; And he would eat up the new atheists just as much as the theists.\n\nIt's an extremely lazy and unimpressive criticism of atheism, by the way, to just suggest we're somehow 'just as bad as the theists' (despite the fact that we are concerned about evidence and logical coherence while theism is not). It's really just a way to avoid addressing the actual content of the arguments while still getting page clicks or selling empty platitudinal titles \"The Dawkins Delusion!\" or \"The God Reality!\" or \"God Actually is Great You Guys, Don't Worry, Those Guys Are Just Jerks And This Will All Blow Over and You can Use This Book as Justification for Staying in Your Bubble Forever\". Well, we're not impressed by any of it, and we're not going anywhere. As long as religion keeps intruding explicitly and overtly on scientific territory, as long as it keeps labelling children with the religion of their parents and imposing its dogma on their vulnerable minds, as long as it keeps poisoning education and politics and impeding scientific and technological progress, we're going to keep calling out its bullshit. Endlessly repeating the hackneyed, transparent line that we're somehow unsophisticated or whatever, will not reverse this trend.","created":"1440286660","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"atheism","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3hkr4q/c/cuca2cm"}

{"author":"Cheesedoodlerrrr","name":"t1_cuic4h2","comment":"All the stats you want and more.  Gizmodo did a really good article on the breakdown.\n\nThere were about 38 million accounts on AM.  Of those, about 5 million were tagged as being female.  That puts the ratio at about 7:1, which is not that far off most online dating sites.\n\nHOWEVER, nearly all of those female accounts were either fake or inactive.  A huge chunk of the female accounts were fake profiles created by AM themselves, and opened with \"@ashleymadison.com\" email addresses.  The profile pictures were ripped off Google images without the files even being renamed.\n\nGizmodo determined that of the 5 million accounts labeled Female, only maybe 15,000 were created by actual real women, and of those *less than 1500* ever bothered to even open their AM inbox.\n\nOf 37,000,000 accounts, there were fewer than 1500 'active' female users.  This puts the ratio at a much more hilarious 2450:1.  The ratio of men on the site was 99.98%.  No one ever actuslly cheated on their wives through AM, because there were literally no women on there at all.  All these men are getting the shaft for being caught on the site, and none of them even got laid!\n\nhttp://gizmodo.com/the-fembots-of-ashley-madison-1726670394","created":"1440738691","avg_score":"4.0","subr":"funny","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"4","url":"http://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3inkix/c/cuic4h2"}

We need to take the current polls with a grain of sand, it's way to early to even think who is going to win. It's now currently a \"who is more know\" stat. And trump is wining that. \n\nI'll say this. Trump wining the primaries against the 16 other republicans and becoming a candidate? It's a possibility, but him wining the national election is quite impossible unless we have a lot more crazies than we believe. \n\nThe main explanation I can think of for why trump is wining is because he is saying what he wants to, and is serious about it. It plays with the \"Political correctness police\" thing that has been going on for a year or so. In the republicans mind \"if it's offending people, than means he is honest and saying facts\" \n\nNow his \"honestly\" has basically killed his chance to win the Nationals because he doesn't have vital support of the Latinos, which is a very very crucial minority in this country. \n\nThe reasonable candidates like Paul and in a odd side Graham, knows that what trump is saying is killing the whole party's chance of wining the Nationals. They are annoyed that trump has hijacked the party and causing it to sink.

{"author":"toiletlad505","name":"t1_cty7biw","comment":"I feel like a good portion of rage comes from the background of the players. A pretty solid part of the league community doesn't have a team sports filled upbringing (even though there are a ton of us who are) and the common causes of rage in league are things you learn to deal with or understand in that setting. say your teammate has a bad game in soccer, you dont shit all over the guy because you know 1) im going to play with this guy again tmrw 2) you know that kicking the guy while he's down doesnt help anything. sports conditions you to want to help teammates even if it is frustrating if their poor play hurts the team. League also provides an opportunity to say whatever you want to people without penalty, sure you can get banned/chat restricted but you can make a new account and start over. There isnt the level of threat that telling someone irl to go get cancer and have their family killed in a car crash when they are anonymous people who can be thousands of miles away. Personally I feel like if you say something online you wouldn't say to someones face youre a fucking coward.  Ive even noticed this sort of trend within my own friend group, the lol players who didnt play sports are much quicker to flame and blame others. This is where i see another diference in the mindset of much of the community from my own, the best players win, almost regardless of the quality of their team.  I was on a team with a guy who got a yellow card in 8 straight games, because after every hat trick he got those games he did a triple backflip. spoets has a mentality of self improvement to lead to better outcomes, why did i lose? well i got tired. so what am i gonna do? imma go run 3 miles for the next month. in league the attitude is more like: why did i lose? fucking gp 0/4 at 14 mins. Which sure is a bad situation, but why aren't you even stronger then the vlad eho poo poo'd on your top? why isnt your lane opponent 0/4 or worse? I think this discrepancy in attitudes is what leads to a lot of rage in league rather than the specific triggers for it.","created":"1439230263","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"leagueoflegends","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3gggjh/c/cty7biw"}

It is actually very hard to find a job in my town, it has one of the highest unemployment rates in California. We also only have one community college and it is near impossible to get the classes you want if you're new (we tried). It's also incredibly boring though this shouldn't matter since the baby would be taking up much of our time. He just feels like it would be better overall, but quitting my job does make me nervous. I work in a very demanding and disliked department in my hospital, and I know they would take me back in a heartbeat if I were to return (people usually leave after a year and we get very short staffed at times). He is just worried that he would't be able to get anything down here and he would be another \"mouth\" to feed. I have met his family several times, and they are actually very nice and leave us alone when I'm there, but this can easily change after a month or two I suppose. I can see that they give him his space and his mom would gladly help babysit if we ask. Thank you for your advice, I really appreciate it :).

{"author":"AmerChemSocietyAMA","name":"t1_cu74gdj","comment":"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has provided insights into the components of matter and how we understand the physical universe. The LHC is 17 miles long and allows particles to be collided at 13 teraelectronvolts (TeV). Annually, CERN requires 1.3 terawatts of electricity to operate, which is enough to power 300,000 homes a year in the UK. The amount of energy the LHC requires to get particle speeds to nearly the speed of light is incredibly high, making a reasonable energy output from the instrument difficult. In the near future, the researchers at CERN seem focused on colliding particles at previously unattained energies in order to study new particles. Currently, the energy required to make these particles is greater than the energy output. In theory, chemical bonds are a good way to store energy, but for these particular particles, this is not feasible given the tremendous energy required for their generation. -Ph.D. Candidate, A.

They're taking all the crap that other airlines bundle into the price of everyone's ticket and making them available a la carte.  I don't drink or eat anything on planes so why should i pay for a free drink and peanuts in difficult to open packages?  \n\nAnd don't get me started on carry-ons.  I either carry what i need in a backpack or I check a bag for longer trips.  You know why?  Because i'm not going to inconvenience everyone else getting on the damn plane trying to get my overweight, oversized carry-on into the overhead bin because I didn't want to pay for checked luggage.  On every other airline you spend forever waiting for little old ladies to get their 45 lb carry on bag down from the overhead bin, but not on spirit.  People check that shit.  There's always bin space if you need it and I've never seen a flight have to gate-check bags.  \n\nIt's basically the greyhound of the sky too, so you get some very \"people of walmart\" moments too.

Hell, most people think that this will result in a request for food aid.\n\nI think this is why we are seeing such a serious posturing from the ROK and US. They are perceiving these talks as two-faced...

{"author":"Thomas__Covenant","name":"t1_cttzxaa","comment":"I had a couple of my friends say the exact same lines to me, \"Welcome to MMO's!\"\n\nLike, what? They acted like it was such a bizarre, foreign concept to me to \"grind\" and \"level\" up my \"gear\". Mother fucker, I've played 20+ years of RPG's, I understand it just fine. \n\nBut here's the thing: A lot of Destiny dick huggers were beating their drums over how \"new\" and \"different\" Destiny was and how difficult it's going to be to blend the two genres together, both FPS and MMO. But why? The groundwork had already been done for them. Twice. It was called Borderlands and Borderlands 2. Obviously this a personal opinion in the extreme minority, but all they had to do was take BL and put it in space. Well, more in space. That's it. They didn't have to attempt to reinvent the wheel, shit was already round to begin with. I mean, look, they're already falling back to regular XP gains instead of latching onto to yet another DOA leveling system. The light level system could never sustain itself. What they've should have been doing was increasing the XP level cap, not the light level cap. The light should have been another attribute, not a one to one to standard XP levels.\n\nAs this main thread can attest to, people have been saying for the past year that this is Destiny's teething phase. They're still trying to figure out how to walk, and now they're on a good run. But for me, I don't buy it. FPS's aren't new. MMO's sure as shit aren't new. No one piece of the Destiny puzzle is new, just the collected package was slightly creative. With Bungie's pedigree, even if it is a completely new team, I'm just utterly shocked at the mess they gave us a year ago.","created":"1438892652","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"DestinyTheGame","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3fz94p/c/cttzxaa"}

{"author":"Canadazed","name":"t1_cul3w7t","comment":"Loophole isn't the best word, as the majority of scripts don't abuse loopholes. Scripts monitor the memory addresses used by the client, the process run by league on your system, and the data packets being sent from the client to the server and back. When Riot figures out which addresses/packets are being monitored they can obfuscate them to break the scripts.\n\nFor these types of simple scripts (calculating skillshots, using items when low, etc.) there isn't a whole lot Riot can do to stop them. This data must be present in your system for the game to run, so it will always be able to be monitored by a script. This becomes a perpetual game of cat and mouse, and will never be solved.\n\nMore advanced scripts and cheats that change mechanics of the game ([example 0 cd summoners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdeXSdq-MFo)) are typically due to a bug. These can normally be fixed in a more permanent sense, as it's usually an oversight on Riot's end. These types of cheats are really rare though, and don't get passed around to the general public because they CAN be fixed.","created":"1440968047","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"leagueoflegends","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3iz0fb/c/cul3w7t"}

{"author":"Drunken_Wanderer","name":"t1_cu62n9t","comment":"Because CBS insists on autoplaying a video for every article:\n\n&gt; Amidst the wild, unpredictable first year of the College Football Playoff, the sport has become \u2026 somewhat stable and predictable.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anything, college football has settled into an easy rhythm having traded the hidden formulas of the BCS computers for the hidden agendas of the CFP Selection Committee.\n&gt; \n&gt; Human logic over logic boards.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK, I'm kidding, but just a little. TCU is still waiting for a proper explanation for being left out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going into year two of the CFP, though, we can make these general assumptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's easier to pick the playoff teams, than it is to pick the playoff winner: The selection committee has laid out a template, even if it is made of parchment paper. For now, let's assume the committee favors conference champions because, well, they do in the small sample size we have available.\n&gt; \n&gt; Start with a list of one man's realistic Power Five 2015 conference contenders.\n&gt; \n&gt; SEC: Alabama, Auburn, Georgia\n&gt; Pac-12: Stanford, USC, Oregon, Arizona State\n&gt; Big 12: TCU, Baylor\n&gt; Big Ten: Michigan State, Ohio State\n&gt; ACC: Florida State, Clemson\n&gt; \n&gt; That's only 13 teams. We can quibble, but your money would do well if the list was limited to picking four from among that group. Those programs have accounted for seven national championships since 2004. Picking four out of 13 means you only need a 31 percent success rate. The unpredictability begins in early December. As No. 4 seed Ohio State showed us, it's harder to pick the playoff winner than it is the playoff participants.\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on history alone, there are only a handful of teams that can win it in any given year. In the BCS era (1998-2013), only 15 teams even played for a championship. Four of those were involved in the first playoff. Include the top four from each year in the BCS era and that overall list grows only to 25 possible contenders.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Power) Five doesn't fit into a (Football) Four: The game's stewards knew that when they launched a postseason that ended up being a multi-million dollar game of musical chairs. There are five power conferences. At most, four of them are going to make it. This doesn't account for Notre Dame or two teams from the same conference getting in. That particular meltdown still awaits.\n&gt; \n&gt; For now, we'll stick to the basics. If -- before last season -- you determined the Big 12 was going to be left out, it was easier to pick Florida State, Alabama, Oregon and Ohio State as the four conference champs who were going to be in. That, in fact, happened in this space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Further evidence of the predictability of the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fallout won't stop: The first big unintended consequence of the CFP was the plight of that musical chairs loser. Everything the Big 12 did, or didn't do, in the offseason seemed to relate to it being left out. Expansion? Championship game? The 'One True Champion' slogan got beaten up worse than one of Ronda Rousey's sparring partners.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here we are a couple of weeks from the start of the 2015 season and the Big 12's 2014 remains a hot topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; What fallout will await the Left Out from this season?\n&gt; \n&gt; The season has been divided into three distinct parts: Part 1: The traditional human polls -- diminished with the advent of the playoff -- are now meaningless after the CFP rankings kick in. This year that's not until Nov. 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part 2: The Tuesday night release of those rankings ratchets up the scrutiny on the regular-season jockeying. That hit home last year when, going into the last week of the season, undefeated Florida State dropped to No. 4. I actually asked CFP chair Jeff Long if the Seminoles were in danger of potentially being left out of the playoff. He did not laugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part 3: The playoff is a separate entity. For Alabama, being the prohibitive No. 1 on Pick \u2018Em Day didn't mean squat. It's how you do in the bracket that counts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Conclusion: Being No. 1 at any point before December, these days, matters less than the process involved in winning the tournament.\n&gt; \n&gt; The New Parity: In early December, who would have thought the Buckeyes would endure? There was the emergence of a \"Cinderella\" -- a rare concept in major-college football -- that added to the appeal and acceptance of the playoff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of the randomness of a tournament, no conference is likely to ever win seven consecutive titles again. Sorry, SEC. Actually, it's going to be hard for any conference to win two in a row. There will be injuries, attrition, fatigue and the odd third-string quarterback in December and January.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assume a new age of parity -- at least for the power conferences -- because \u2026\n&gt; \n&gt; The playoff has solidified a caste system that further rewards the elite: The playoff is an upgrade over the BCS in that a four-team playoff will account for every undefeated major conference team. The last time there were as many as three power conference unbeatens was 2004.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's hard to imagine in this age an unbeaten SEC champion being left out. That actually happened to Auburn 12 years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; The unknown: What does Boise State -- or another Group of Five team -- have to do to get in the top four? Consider this scenario: The committee evaluating a 13-0 Boise vs. an 11-2 SEC champion for the last playoff spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; The known: Unless things change drastically, the SEC champion is guaranteed to get a spot in any given year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Talk of an eight-team bracket won't go away: In one sense, it would be easy to expand the field. In another, it's next to impossible. Adding another layer of playoffs might mean the elimination of conference championship games. That would require the CFP to buy the SEC out of its game, for starters, ending a traditional and lucrative postseason Southern football holiday in Atlanta.\n&gt; \n&gt; Plus, player welfare will continue to be a huge issue. If those conference title games stay, we're talking about a 16-game season for two teams. In an eight-team bracket, four semifinal teams would be playing 15 games.\n&gt; \n&gt; If something does happen, look for it to occur after the 2019 season. There is a window after that season for the CFP for evaluate the \u201chost\u201d bowls (Fiesta, Cotton, Peach).","created":"1439832714","avg_score":"5.0","subr":"CFB","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"5","url":"http://reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3hc6b0/c/cu62n9t"}

{"author":"hellafitz","name":"t1_cuau7c1","comment":"He may just not be ready for it, especially if you're both pretty young.  It's a big step.  But talking it out is always best.  Just try to make sure he does actually vocalize what his position is.  Even if it doesn't work out that you two move in together *now*, that doesn't mean that anything you two talk out wouldn't be advantageous for the future when you *do* move in together.\n\nLiving with someone is hard.  Living with your SO is even harder.  You become partners AND roommates, and both have all their own issues and needed compromises.  If you have a productive talk about what both your expectations, needs and boundaries regarding living together are he might come out feeling a lot more comfortable about the idea.\n\nAnd I get you, I *can* be doing my own thing in the company of someone else and be content with that alone time - with the exception of that crazy ex who would ask me what I'm doing every 10 seconds while I'm sitting 10 feet away with a book in my lap.... (/eye roll)  But the silence thing figures into it as well.  I enjoy some reprieve from constant noise sometimes.  I can read or knit while he's watching tv, but sometimes I just want to turn all the sounds off.  Other things factor in too.  He's also not as into music as I am and sometimes I'd rather listen to music while doing something else than watch tv.  Or when I'm playing single player video games (even on my handheld systems) I prefer to just hear the video game, with *some* exceptions to that.   In general, I prefer not to have more than one auditory presence at a time whereas he needs noise going on mostly all of the time.  Another \"fun\" anecdote about that one ex with personal space issues: He would regularly play video games or watch tv, while playing youtube videos on his laptop on the floor next to him, while also sporadically playing his guitar.

{"author":"gniguhcraig","name":"t1_cttmayf","comment":"I'm not necessarily worried, as I've mained a max agility bladedancer with blink since the day I unlocked the subclass and appropriate perks but the vault isn't all that \"huge\" if you think about it.. There's only about 30 second of movement needed for even the slowest guardians to get from one encounter to the next. Sure the areas are pretty massive if you only account the 3D area of it but a lot of its feeling of massiveness is due to the vertical element. In reality I don't think it's much more to traverse overall than CE but crota relies on a lot more horizontal movement than anything. This and the fact that you're almost always hindered by in game mechanics (the lamps/weight of darkness, shrieker barriers and the two bridge formation points) and/or masses of high level enemies in your path to \"point b\" (thralls in the maze/first bridge point, ogers/other adds at the second bridge, and witches/adds at deathsinger) give a sense of a smaller scale imo. You're almost constantly forced to fight your way through to your objective and this prevents you from feeling the scale of the environment around you as you aren't ever really moving at your own pace. The vault has quite a few portions where you move as quickly as you please through its cavernous architecture. The largest areas in crota where you move at a fast pace are in the maze and between the darkness there and your inability to move as you please/sightsee there (both in the descent and the traversal of the maze itself) holds you back from realizing just how large that area itself is and that's only about half of the raid's area. \n\nOverall neither of them seem much bigger than a lot of the area passed through in a strike or close to that of a patrol. Just my opinion at least. I think the scale of the dreadnaught will be created by a combination of very open areas where enemies are only found near choke points into the parts of the ship where you'll face a lot of enemies in tighter and more linear areas leading to bosses, valuable loot, or storyline info/objectives. Sort of blending the two previous raid's approaches into one. It'll likely be quite a bit bigger than both of them combined though as you'll essentially be seeing what it'd be like to be able to initiate any given story mission, stike, or raid while patrolling a planet just by going to the beginning of said activity's location with the necessary prerequisites met. That's how I'm picturing it. \n\nCertain areas of the dreadnaught will likely be completely inaccessible without first acquiring the tools or story \"keys\" from completing the activities lined up for you in previous portions while also ascending to the level required to take that activity on. In this way, bungie would be able to mitigate the players who are further along from \"carrying\" others through story elements they aren't/shouldn't be ready to take on and prevent it entirely in certain cases (activities that would provide those who complete it with powerful weapons/armor that they want you to properly \"earn\" by playing through the storyline). There will obviously still be independent strikes/missions that are initiated from orbit but the dreadnaught itself might only give access to these once they've been completed for the first time by \"properly\" discovering and completing them through the patrol portion. \n\nI could be entirely wrong on how this will work but I think it'd be welcomed by most/all so long as the dreadnaught isn't an overly grueling area to traverse, which is why, imo, the OP has a valid reason to be concerned over the recently anounced lack of sparrows in the destination.

Then I make a whole bunch of plants and animals.  Then I make a thing called a man... and then make him sad because he doesn't have a second, like all the other things.  This is the seed from which the fermentation of jealousy will happen in the species, which will be fun to watch grow later.  But not right now.\n\nI then make him a second, a woman.  I make her pretty and desirable, and everything he wants... and I already know she wants him.  This will later help to grow lust.  Together with jealousy?  Hell yeah, this is gonna be a hoot!\n\nTHEN.. just to top it all off... I make a tree of knowledge, and I tell them to not eat of it.  Because I'm like that.  I tell 'em they'll die if they do... which is true, from a certain point of view...\n\nThen I give the serpent the ability to talk, and sort of 'poke' him in the direction of deceptive thinking and subversiveness.  The serpent'll do his thing, and the woman will eat the fruit.  She'll learn quick, and'll use her womanly ways to convince the man to eat the fruit too.\n\nThey'll try to hide from me, being shamed of their nakedness and their 'sin', having learned deceit and shame, but I'll play the game... \"where are you?

Forever, most of them will squeal like pigs at the sight of them, and think of them as evil things.\n\nAnd then, them humans'll go out in the world, and do whatever it is that these seeds I've planted in them will do.\n\nYeah.

{"author":"vfdsugarbowl","name":"t1_cuce4ic","comment":"I've had to investigate a number of these myself. It sucks all around, it's incredibly emotionally taxing for everyone involved. The challenge is that you've got a field full of professionals (the administrators) who got into the field because they enjoy educating students and making a positive impact. Then, the legal aspect is incredibly complicated, and so these same people are having to learn and keep up with legal boundaries that they may have little professional experience in. In other words, there aren't very many experts out there and we need a ton of experts. To give you a sense of the administrative paperwork involved, there was a case where one student allegedly touched another briefly and inappropriately high up on the leg. That two second encounter gave me about 10 hours or so of work over the course of the week and didn't end in satisfying results for anyone involved.\n \nIn my personal opinion, everyone should be throwing as many resources as they can at educating about substance use, sex, and consent, ESPECIALLY in k-12. Because in my experience, the common denominator is that students often drink more than they understand is reasonable and use language about sex that they've picked up from music and movies that isn't realistic. This is true of college men and women and everything in between. The victims aren't just women (but typically are) and the perpetrators aren't just men (but typically are). Some schools are doing some pretty effective sex positive education programs, like Colorado State's Consent Turns Me On program!\n\nIt's a huge topic, and I am firmly in support of the hard work of the various activists out there - with a specific shout out to KnowYourIX.org.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions about this like how the law applies or whatever, just let me know!\n\n","created":"1440294407","avg_score":"8.0","subr":"IAmA","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"8","url":"http://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3hzfuy/c/cuce4ic"}

{"author":"mahcbets","name":"t1_cu9hfg7","comment":"Navi vs Titan\n\nBO1 \n\nCSGO Lounge Link: http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5022\n\nTitan has been playing inconsistently as a high level tier two team winning 16:2 against LGB, lost 25:23 to EBettle, 16:8ed K1ck and 16:5ed Gamers2. Titan has not played many matches, but the few they did they played very inconsistently. \n\nNavi has been playing decently consistently as a top four team losing 3-1 to VP, 2-0ed Mous, 2-1ed Tempostorm, 2-0ed Dignitas and Luminosity, lost 2-1 to TSM, 2-1ed Kinguin, lost 16:14 to C9, 16:12ed VP and 2-1ed C9. Navi have not been looking amazing, but they have been able to beat the majority of the teams they face.\n\nHistorically Navi and Titan have always been close head to head. \n\nOverall Navi is slightly the better team because Navi has been playing a bit better against other teams and is a top four team, but in the past Navi and Titan has always been close. This match is even more risky because this is a BO1 and Titan has been playing inconsistently. Your best bet would be to go low on Titan or skip as I give Navi 60/40 odds here.\n\nThe Spreadsheet: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R2BEcuQAQCfMG4Arz8yQd5TlnJJd6sJuZGxxG1FAxkw/edit?usp=sharing \n\nYou can PM me if you would like a direct invite to the steam group by either me linking the steam group or you linking your steam profile. \n\nBefore upvote or downvote please write in a reply why you are doing so so I can improve my analysis for the benefit of everyone thank you &lt;3 \n\nKeep in mind that the odds on Lounge are subject to change after I post analysis.","created":"1440080610","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"csgobetting","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/csgobetting/comments/3hgbwb/c/cu9hfg7"}

{"author":"Deathbycurves","name":"t1_cuhe82v","comment":"Okay, let me give this a try. \nI've never seen a Mad Max Movie, and yes I know I'm missing out. But I will write down my thoughts while looking at the picture, however vague they may be. \n \nOkay, first picture: \n\nThere are some white dudes worshiping what looks like a gate that let's water flow. Looks like this is a hydraulic empire? The \"normal\" folks are probably begging for water in front of guards and a leader/king that has a horse mouth and military decorations. Said King sits on top of women who are apparently getting milked (eww) by a machine? A king needs his fresh glass of milk everyday I guess. I can't explain the small man on the top right, but it looks like some prophet/observer. \n \nSecond picture: \n\nWell, there are many vehicles and since I've seen a trailer, I assume they are used for most of the film.  We see prisoners up top with one apparently drained by one of the white dudes (for water/nutrition?). Several women want to escape / run, with whites dudes in pursuit. One of the women is pregnant, so I think they don't want to get milked. It also looks like they want to run toward an oasis / paradise like place, maybe with the train in the lower left. I can't really explain the bird lady, could be a protector of the escaping women. Then we see other vehicles, motorcycles that is. They have guns above them, so probably the vehicle of choice for hunters. We also see seeds and a growing plant inside a skull. The pot could represent gold? Then we see ravens and dried up trees. This probably tells the story of the drought and the hardships that nothing grows without money? Or maybe nothing grows because the people in power don't sell seeds? \n \nLast picture: \n\nSome of the women are seen on a platform, they got caught (but not milked yet, phew...), but the pregnant woman is missing (dead?). On the left we see an uniquely clothed man who didn't appear yet and I have no idea what he's doing there. The normal folks are again worshiping the water. In the middle on a horse statue lies a corpse, the river shows a white dude (the one draining a prisoner, he was probably the main protagonist?) crossing over to what I assume is the afterlife. Down below are other white dudes controlling a mechanism and engines, maybe this is used to control the Watergate. \n \nThat's it, couldn't guess more about the picture. I probably missed a whole lot and was wrong about everything else. Please try not to spoiler me as much, I still want to enjoy the movie.","created":"1440680629","avg_score":"25.0","subr":"movies","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"25","url":"http://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3iksuk/c/cuhe82v"}

{"author":"frownifdown","name":"t1_ctrdvz3","comment":"This is by far the dumbest thing that gets circulated on this sub. The reason Jesus cursed this tree was because it had leaves that only appear when it had fruit. It's very possible that in the context of the story Jesus made the tree appear that way to use it as an object lesson to his disciples. If you would just read a little bit further you'd see that he relates it to his disciples basically saying that if you're going to call yourself a Christian (analogous to the tree having the leaves) then you should bear the fruits that exemplify what he perceived to be Christian principles (kindness, patience, love, etc.). This isn't some story about a madman who thought that there were figs and then cursed the tree just because he was wrong. It's a story about a teacher using a real life object lesson to impart a message to his students.\n\nIt's something I wish we would all take to heart. If we are going to call ourselves skeptics and free thinkers then can we let our actions show it? Let's do a little research before just jumping on the \"WOO JESUS IS CRAZY HE DONT KNOW WHEN FIGS COME\" bandwagon? I disagree with so much stuff in the bible and with what Jesus said, but this isn't what it's made out to be here.

{"author":"ShadowDraken","name":"t1_cttvt9t","comment":"I am black (not African-american) and I am slightly racist towards other black people. I have lived in america for most of my life and moved a lot and I have seen a large split between cultures from races. For example I was bullied in both South Carolina(mostly white) and South Florida(more hispanic and black) but more frequently in South Florida. Many Black people in my area seem to lack intelligence and good decency. Its not that I hate black people I hate major aspects of Black culture and a person of any race can be apart of black culture it's just that most black people emulate black culture. One of my black friends that likes rap music and puts effort in his education is one of my closest friends. But one of his female friends who is ghetto is a nice person but makes me mad because of her personality. She doesn't try and is proud of it and that absolutely pisses me off because she is making black people look bad. So I blame most of the time why people look down on black people because of black people. Wouldn't you look down on a criminal who has done unforgivable or heinous acts? Then how would you feel if a large portion of race was like that. What makes my racist different is that I understand that Black people are not bad just because they are black. There is no biological basis for why I don't like those of my race. It is due to the culture that has been build by black and there refusal to help change it(some try to change obviously). I hate this culture because it effects my image and how people react. \n\nSo when I see a black person I see a human who is black. But when I see a back person who dresses ghetto does not behave in social acceptable ways or HAS NO LIFE GOALS I tend to view them as sub humans.","created":"1438886904","avg_score":"75.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"75","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3g08j0/c/cttvt9t"}

{"author":"orangekitti","name":"t1_cug7ujo","comment":"The thing with temporary breaks is, they almost never work and they are inherently confusing.  You say you need \"time alone\" to process your feelings and get over your anger issues- and I'd agree.  I think it would be a great idea for you to be single for a while and focus on yourself.  Can't give your best to your partner or be in a happy relationship when you're struggling to control your reactions.\n\nBut what does \"time alone\" or \"temporary\" mean to you?  How long do you need?  How long is your girlfriend supposed to wait?  Do you have a definite end time in mind, or is she going to be on the hook for months?  Is she allowed to see other people during this time?  Or do you want her to stay single too, in some sort of relationship limbo?\n\nDo you see how unfair it is to ask this of her?  You're basically expecting her to be okay with not seeing other guys while not getting any sort of emotional or physical affection from you.  She's not going to be able to pick up the phone and call you the same way she's used to, and she can't call another guy.  You won't be having sex, but she can't have sex with other people.  Or, if she IS allowed to date, what happens if she really likes someone she meets?  Will she feel guilty?  Will you get back together and find out you resent her for sleeping with someone else?\n\nDumping all this on her and being flummoxed that she's upset is kind of sucky OP.  **You can't really know how long your recovery is going to take, and that's not a bad thing, because you don't want to rush your therapy and self-reflection; however, you cannot reasonably expect another person to be okay with putting their own life and emotional and physical needs on hold for some unknown period of time.**","created":"1440595856","avg_score":"45.0","subr":"relationships","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"45","url":"http://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3igpa8/c/cug7ujo"}

{"author":"Prometheus720","name":"t1_ctwab7b","comment":"There is a documentary on Netflix called Fed Up which will explain this in more depth than I can.\n\nHowever, most fat-free or reduced-fat products lose the taste associated with that fat. They taste kind of awful, usually. Food companies add sugar to replace the taste lost from removing the fat. And that is worse for you than the fat, generally speaking.\n\nAlso, some fats help make you feel more satisfied by your food. Removing that fat can mean you'll feel hungrier after eating the food, and that you will eat more of it.\n\n&gt; It's not like nonfat milk or yogurt has added sugar right?\n\nAgain, PLEASE watch that documentary. It's very good. I don't know where you live, but in America, your yogurt almost certainly has added sugar if it's anything but plain. That may not be related to the fact that it's nonfat, but in some cases you may as well eat ice-cream. \n\nOne more cardinal rule is that if you eat sugar, you want to be eating fiber with it. Fruit has sugar, but it also has fiber. So that's fine. But if you add sugar to a drink? Not good for you. The fiber is good for your poops, of course, but it will also help to stop you from absorbing all that sugar.","created":"1439072240","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3g6pcf/c/ctwab7b"}

It doesn't work that way.  \n\nA car cuts a semi off, it's the car's fault. But the truckers here seem to think that if they cut a car off, the car should have anticipated their move and gotten out of the way. If you don't signal getting close to the bottom of the hill, then cut me off, how am I supposed to know you want to get over until I'm slamming on my brakes? I don't want to be in danger any more than you do.

Ronaldo already scored 42 goals while playing in the premier league, before he hit his prime even at the age of 22/23. So basically, you can't say that he wouldn't score as many when he already scored close to that amount in the premier league when he wasn't at his prime yet, so logically, once he got to his prime he would get more goals as he has done at Madrid. He would still score more goals at United if he stayed, and probably around 50, considering he scored 42 that year.

The entirety of the industry is behind VR in a way that was NEVER EVER EVER the case for motion game peripherals. You keep ignoring that key difference. \n\n&gt;  Why do you think Oculus STILL hasn't released yet?\n\nWhat's that supposed to mean exactly? Is pointing out the fact that companies don't release unfinished products supposed to be revelatory or something?\n\nYour entire argument rest on the idea that whatever new product companies release, it will always be dead on arrival because REASONS. Do you not see how absolutely asinine it is to start your conversation with that supposition? Motion gaming ended up as it did because of lack of support. That support is CLEARLY present this time around. Motion gaming peripherals did NOT have that much, if ANY competition. Competition drives companies to eat up losses, which would mean that they will probably keep supporting their product throughout the inevitable rocky first generation of these machines. \n","created":"1438443322","avg_score":"3.0","subr":"PS4","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"3","url":"http://reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/3fe9c0/c/ctnypnu"}

I saw this movie with two of my good friends ready for something fun and unique, but we just kept rolling our eyes.\n\nThe first 20 minutes of the film was good and promised good fun, but the rest of the movie just got bad, really bad. The sound design was terrible, each time a gun was shot it sounded completely different than the next. At one scene, a police department blows up and it didn't even sound like an explosion, just a complete jumbled mess (like the movie itself). The score was the most generic music you can probably find on iMovie, and it just wasn't funny. Sure some scenes made us chuckle (especially Einsenberg) but nothing more. But TOPHER FUCKING GRACE was SO miscast. He was not funny, he was not intimidating, and throughout the whole movie we had no idea why he was trying to kill them in the first place! Maybe I didn't pay attention in the beginning but this \"villain\" showed NO MOTIVATION AT ALL.\n\nThis movie wants to be so many things: funny, dramatic, romantic, thrilling but it just fell flat at everything. We were actually bored. Maybe Stuckmann hated Agent 47 and Sinister so much that he tricked himself to thinking this was good but it really was not a good movie. At all.

I was the only designer in the class that was otherwise communications or journalism students, so I was the lead graphic designer. I also had some of the most experience in a TV studio having taken a similar class in high school, so I quickly became a go-to person in the studio to either fill technical positions during taping or help with editing stories for the show. I was also a segment producer on the show with another student where we wrote, shot, and edited a weekly technology news segment.\n\nAt the end of that semester, we pulled out all the stops for a final show. I re-created the virtual set (since we shot on greenscreen), stepped up the quality of the tech stories, created a slideshow of draft picks for the sports segment, and even wrote a piece of music to use during the show (which we ended up cutting out because we dropped the segment before taping). Because of this particular show, we won several awards, including a regional Emmy, which I am particularly proud of.","created":"1440696592","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3imdn2/c/cuho5cy"}

In warcraft lore, that makes him a mage. Granted, when actually fighting, he used melee combat and not magic. \n\nAnyway, if there can be nerubian rogues in Warcraft lore, how do we determine whether Anub'arak is a warrior or a rogue? Rogues are really a type of warrior, their methods of fighting are just different. It's not so clear cut as it is with human characters, since all nerubians are big tanky things.\n\nMy point is that Anub'Arak isn't so solidly defined as a warrior as say Tyrande is a priest, so I wouldn't be worried about Blizzard \"changing\" the classes of other major characters.

{"author":"BCP27","name":"t1_cuk8bvl","comment":"I'm going with the Clippers, and here's why. \n\nFirst off, it isn't the Bulls or Hawks, leaving us with the Cavs, Spurs, Thunder, Rockets, and Clips. \n\nKyrie Irving might not be back until January, which is the reason I'm dropping the Cavs.\n\nThe Thunder, even if healthy, have new players to get used to, along with a new coach. The Spurs also have a new star player to adapt to, and they lost some good, but not key players. \n\nThis leaves the Rockets and Clips. Both are mostly the same, but with a couple key factors. Both improved their rosters in ways which shouldn't effect continuity too much, and expect to be healthier than they were last year, referring to Dwight and Blake. \n\nTo choose which of the two, I thought of how they performed in the Playoffs last year. Obviously, the Rockets won the series, but a lot of that appeared to be due to major depth issues the Clippers had, and prior to these finally showing in their starters, they were dominating the series. \n\nIt's close, but I'm rolling with the Clips as having the 2nd best regular season record this year. Now, if LMA meshes immediately, Kyrie returns quickly, Ty Lawson flourishes, Enes Kanter stops being terrible, or their Clips bench is once again a disaster, this all changes.

What are you expecting these 'experts' to be judging the players on themselves?\n\n&gt;And this has little to do with my bias towards Attacking football. Its the reality. The objective of the game itself is to Score. The game dynamic is itself structured that way. Of course Playmaker and attackers are more relevant.\n\nThat must be why all games end 7-6...\n\n&gt;A team does not have equal 10% contribution from the 10 outfield players.\n\nDidn't say it did, I said the one guy orchestrating the entire defensive unit is important. Hence captains traditionally being defenders/keepers/defensive mids.\n\n&gt;And for your info Beckenbauer being a Sweeper is what my comment meant.\n\nMhm.

There can be nothing to declare a definitive Greatest of All-Time, that has been my argument, and to claim there can be one is both stubborn and ignorant. You've agreed that statistics don't tell the whole story, and opinions can vary, which leaves nothing left. You pin your entire stance on the opinion of 'experts', which could be worse, but those football experts are still just exerting their opinions, it's fine for you to value them higher than my opinion, but don't take it as absolute. The entire discussion is moot due to variables, weight of importance and differing opinions on them. This applies to asking 20 billion people, or 10 'experts', it's all the same. There have been numerous discussions with groups of former players, journalists, etc. that also do not agree with one another, even if you exclude Messi as his career is still ongoing, it will forever be unanswerable, and that is the only guaranteed aspect of the entire topic.","created":"1439316176","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"soccer","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3gifsf/c/ctze8iu"}

If you think there arent ways to rate music in a non subjective way i dont know what to tell you. theres a reason to 10 lists are filled with alot of the same people and not Vanilla ice. If he said it was his favorite album i wouldnt give a shit but he said it was the best which is not true at all and there are numerous criteria to back that up. Im saying its wrong because it is such a ridiculous opinion that hes the one who needs to provide some back up, notmyself.

{"author":"YeastInVagMakesBread","name":"t1_cu1n2du","comment":"It depends on what you mean by quality.\n\nI'm in my last year of film school. I've seen projects that were shot on HD cameras, have incredible and artistic lighting, great sound quality, but the plot was the most bland generic stereotypical trope ever.\n\nI've seen projects that were actually hilarious, suspenseful, thoughtful and intriguing, but were filmed disastrously.\n\nWhat it boils down to when looking to make a high quality (production or plot) project is that there are anywhere from a couple to a couple dozen to a couple hundred people working on it all kinds of different positions. Their skill, attention to detail, talent, dedication, focus, attitude, preparedness, resources, time, energy, equipment, training, and leadership all affect the outcome of their work in their role, which all adds to the bigger picture (pun intended).\n\nIt's incredibly hard or incredibly easy to make a film. It all depends on your crew and the leadership of the director and/or the producer. \n\nIf you have an idea, pitch it to a filmmaking friend! Post it on a filmmaking sub! Learn how to write a screenplay online. It's great fun and a productive hobby, even if you don't end up filming it, it's so satisfying to have made something like that. Even if you don't want a career in film, a lot of people make it into a hobby.","created":"1439478909","avg_score":"1.0","subr":"AskReddit","controversiality":"0","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"1","url":"http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3guur2/c/cu1n2du"}

{"author":"Professor_Polymath","name":"t1_cu8vcvv","comment":"This guy is insanely, inexplicably successful despite never being more than marginally funny and having never produced or starred in a film that was worth watching more than twice, often they weren't worth watching once. And despite it, he's still working consistently (He has THREE upcoming films at various points in Post Production), and is still able to continue producing films through Happy Madison. Which is great for most of the people he uses, because 80% of them have no career left beyond his movies. Especially Rob Schneider.\n\nIn all seriousness, think about it: Shakes The Clown, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights, Anger Management, Click, I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, You Don't mess with The Zohan, Jack and Jill, and That's My Boy are all complete garbage. He provided background voices in the two Deuce Bigalow movies, he appeared as a \"Townie\" in The Animal, and he appeared as Satan in Dirty Work, all more garbage.\n\nPunch Drunk Love is insanely awkward and was over-hyped and far over-rated at the time of it's release (surprise, surprise it's mostly been forgotten despite being praised at the time as a \"turning point\" in Sandler's career), Waterboy was mildly amusing on first viewing if you were under 20 when it came out, but it doesn't hold up at all. Big Daddy was tolerable, and even fairly amusing at first glance, but isn't worth more than one viewing anyway. 50 First Dates was boring and largely unfunny, Grown Ups is only amusing if you're a middle-aged suburbanite parent who has no taste in films, etc... His last few movies haven't even been particularly profitable, Pixels is a complete disaster.\n\nI'd trade 50 Sandlers to have John Candy back.","created":"1440026532","avg_score":"2.0","subr":"movies","controversiality":"1","distinguished":null,"downs":"0","ups":"2","url":"http://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3hmylk/c/cu8vcvv"}

{"author":"goblinish","name":"t1_cui398p","comment":"Yeah the sooner you do it the better. It just protects you and the dog from being in that uncertain situation.  We had a family once bring in a sick dog (parvo), surrendering it because they couldn't afford treatment and he was on his way out.  Our vet did everything she could to help this dog recover and when he did they tried to argue that they wanted him back without paying any of his treatment costs. They started causing a scene so we called the cops to have them removed.   If they had spent a few dollar to get the dog vaccinated he wouldn't have gotten sick. Instead the costs ended up not worth it to them until he was fine then suddenly they wanted him back.  \n\nHe got rehomed, though to another client of ours who fell in love with him.  \nSo yeah keep yourself covered and get documentation.

{"author":"skb96","name":"t1_cu72i5w","comment":"You make some good points but let me offer an explanation as to why it will\n\nFloyd has transcended the sport and is head and shoulders above everyone else in it. When he leaves there is a spot to fill. \n\nAll the awful matchmaking in the past years has been related to people trying to strategically position themselves towards the mayweathers and Pacquiao's of the land, taking the risk free option. When they retire, there is no need for such and fans will be avle to put pressure on fighters to scratch and claw for the top spot. Like you said here have been signs of upsets happening and that is manifest to my claim that the threshold that Floyd has over the sport has stunted the development of the top welterweights like Thurman and Khan\n\nNot everyone can get away with the Floyd mentality because they cannot sell themselves like he can outside of the ring, so they will have to let their fists do the talking and fight to develop an appreciable legacy in the fight game.
